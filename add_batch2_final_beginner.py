        "theory": "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. In our data-driven world, statistical literacy is essential for making informed decisions. Whether reading news articles, conducting research, or analyzing business performance, we encounter statistics daily. The goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data to understand patterns, make predictions, and support decision-making. Data are individual pieces of information collected from observations or measurements. Data can be qualitative or categorical, describing attributes like color or gender, or quantitative or numerical, representing measurable quantities like height or temperature. Quantitative data can be discrete, taking only specific values like number of students, or continuous, taking any value within a range like weight or time. A population is the complete set of all individuals or items being studied. A sample is a subset of the population selected for analysis. We use sample statistics to make inferences about population parameters. For example, if we want to know the average height of all adults in a country, measuring everyone is impractical, so we measure a representative sample and use that to estimate the population average. Measures of central tendency describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The mean, often called the average, is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. For a dataset with n values x1, x2, up to xn, the mean denoted x bar equals the quantity x1 plus x2 plus dot dot dot plus xn all divided by n. For example, for the dataset 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9, the mean equals the quantity 4 plus 8 plus 6 plus 5 plus 3 plus 9 divided by 6 equals 35 divided by 6 approximately equals 5.83. The mean is sensitive to extreme values called outliers. The median is the middle value when data are arranged in order. For an odd number of values, it is the value in the center position. For an even number of values, it is the average of the two middle values. For the dataset 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 arranged in order, the median is the average of 5 and 6, which is 5.5. The median is resistant to outliers and better represents typical value for skewed data. The mode is the value that appears most frequently. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), many modes (multimodal), or no mode if all values occur equally. For the dataset 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 4, 7, the mode is 4 because it appears three times. Measures of dispersion or spread describe how scattered or concentrated the data are. The range is the simplest measure, calculated as the maximum value minus the minimum value. For the dataset 3, 7, 2, 9, 5, the range equals 9 minus 2 equals 7. The range only uses two values and ignores everything in between. Variance and standard deviation provide more comprehensive measures. The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. For a population with N values, the population variance denoted sigma squared equals the sum of the quantity xi minus mu squared divided by N, where mu is the population mean. For a sample with n values, the sample variance denoted s squared equals the sum of the quantity xi minus x bar squared divided by n minus 1, where x bar is the sample mean. We divide by n minus 1 for the sample to get an unbiased estimate. Standard deviation is the square root of variance, bringing the measure back to the original units. Population standard deviation is sigma, and sample standard deviation is s. For example, consider the dataset 4, 8, 6. The mean is 4 plus 8 plus 6 divided by 3 equals 6. Deviations from mean: 4 minus 6 equals negative 2, 8 minus 6 equals 2, 6 minus 6 equals 0. Squared deviations: 4, 4, 0. Variance equals 4 plus 4 plus 0 divided by 3 minus 1 equals 8 divided by 2 equals 4. Standard deviation equals the square root of 4 equals 2. Data can be organized using frequency tables showing how many times each value occurs. Grouped frequency tables group data into intervals called classes. Graphs and charts provide visual representations. Bar charts display categorical data with rectangular bars. Histograms show quantitative data distributions with adjacent bars. Pie charts show proportions of a whole. Line graphs display data trends over time. Box plots show five-number summary: minimum, first quartile Q1, median Q2, third quartile Q3, and maximum. Quartiles divide ordered data into four equal parts. Q1 is the median of the lower half, Q2 is the overall median, and Q3 is the median of the upper half. The interquartile range IQR equals Q3 minus Q1, measuring the spread of the middle 50 percent of data. Outliers can be identified as values below Q1 minus 1.5 times IQR or above Q3 plus 1.5 times IQR.",
        "intuition": "Think of statistics as tools for summarizing information in a large dataset. Instead of listing thousands of numbers, we use a few key values like mean and standard deviation to capture the essence. The mean tells you the typical value, while standard deviation tells you how much values typically differ from that average. Visualizing data with graphs is like creating a picture worth a thousand numbers, helping us see patterns and trends instantly.",

# Module 9: Polynomials
polynomials = {
    "module_id": "polynomials",
    "module_name": "Polynomials",
    "level": "beginner",
    "learning_objectives": ["Understand polynomial expressions and their classification", "Perform operations on polynomials including addition, subtraction, and multiplication", "Factor polynomials using various techniques", "Solve polynomial equations and find roots"],
    "core_content": {
        "theory": "A polynomial is an algebraic expression consisting of variables and coefficients combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication, with non-negative integer exponents. Polynomials are fundamental in algebra and appear throughout mathematics and applications. The general form of a polynomial in one variable x is a sub n times x to the power n plus a sub n minus 1 times x to the power n minus 1 plus dot dot dot plus a sub 1 times x plus a sub 0, where the a values are coefficients and n is a non-negative integer. For example, 3x squared plus 5x minus 2, x cubed minus 4x plus 7, and 5x to the fourth minus 2x squared plus x minus 9 are all polynomials. Each part separated by plus or minus is called a term. The coefficient is the numerical factor in each term. The degree of a term is the exponent of the variable. The degree of the polynomial is the highest degree of any term. For 3x squared plus 5x minus 2, the terms are 3x squared, 5x, and negative 2. The degrees are 2, 1, and 0. The polynomial degree is 2. Polynomials are classified by degree. A polynomial of degree 0 is a constant, like 5. Degree 1 is linear, like 2x plus 3. Degree 2 is quadratic, like x squared minus 4x plus 1. Degree 3 is cubic, like x cubed plus 2x squared minus x plus 5. Degree 4 is quartic. Degree 5 is quintic. Polynomials are also classified by number of terms. A monomial has one term, like 5x cubed. A binomial has two terms, like 3x plus 7. A trinomial has three terms, like x squared plus 5x plus 6. The leading term is the term with the highest degree, and its coefficient is the leading coefficient. For 4x cubed minus 2x squared plus x minus 3, the leading term is 4x cubed and the leading coefficient is 4. Adding and subtracting polynomials involves combining like terms. Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power. To add polynomials, remove parentheses and combine like terms. For example, add 3x squared plus 5x minus 2 and x squared minus 3x plus 7. Combine: 3x squared plus x squared equals 4x squared. 5x minus 3x equals 2x. Negative 2 plus 7 equals 5. Result: 4x squared plus 2x plus 5. For subtraction, distribute the negative sign and combine. Subtract x squared minus 3x plus 4 from 5x squared plus 2x minus 1. This is 5x squared plus 2x minus 1 minus the quantity x squared minus 3x plus 4. Distribute: 5x squared plus 2x minus 1 minus x squared plus 3x minus 4. Combine: 4x squared plus 5x minus 5. Multiplying polynomials requires multiplying each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second. For monomials, multiply coefficients and add exponents of like variables. For example, 3x squared times 5x cubed equals 15x to the fifth. For a monomial times a polynomial, use the distributive property. For 2x times the quantity 3x squared minus 4x plus 5, multiply: 2x times 3x squared equals 6x cubed. 2x times negative 4x equals negative 8x squared. 2x times 5 equals 10x. Result: 6x cubed minus 8x squared plus 10x. For binomials, use FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last. For x plus 3 times x plus 5, First: x times x equals x squared. Outer: x times 5 equals 5x. Inner: 3 times x equals 3x. Last: 3 times 5 equals 15. Combine: x squared plus 8x plus 15. Special products save time. The square of a binomial: the quantity a plus b squared equals a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. The quantity a minus b squared equals a squared minus 2ab plus b squared. Difference of squares: a plus b times a minus b equals a squared minus b squared. Factoring is writing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. It is the reverse of multiplication. The first step is always to factor out the greatest common factor GCF. For 6x cubed minus 9x squared plus 3x, the GCF is 3x. Factor: 3x times the quantity 2x squared minus 3x plus 1. Factoring trinomials of form x squared plus bx plus c: find two numbers whose product is c and whose sum is b. For x squared plus 7x plus 12, find numbers with product 12 and sum 7. These are 3 and 4. Factor: x plus 3 times x plus 4. For trinomials ax squared plus bx plus c where a is not 1, use methods like grouping or trial and error. Special factoring patterns: difference of squares: a squared minus b squared equals the quantity a plus b times the quantity a minus b. Sum or difference of cubes: a cubed plus b cubed equals the quantity a plus b times the quantity a squared minus ab plus b squared. A cubed minus b cubed equals the quantity a minus b times the quantity a squared plus ab plus b squared. Perfect square trinomials: a squared plus 2ab plus b squared equals the quantity a plus b squared. A squared minus 2ab plus b squared equals the quantity a minus b squared. The zero product property states that if a times b equals 0, then a equals 0 or b equals 0. This is used to solve polynomial equations by factoring. To solve ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0, factor the left side, set each factor equal to zero, and solve. For example, solve x squared plus 5x plus 6 equals 0. Factor: the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x plus 3 equals 0. Set factors to zero: x plus 2 equals 0 gives x equals negative 2. X plus 3 equals 0 gives x equals negative 3. Solutions are x equals negative 2 and x equals negative 3. The roots or zeros of a polynomial are the values of x that make the polynomial equal zero. Graphically, they are the x-intercepts. The remainder theorem states that when polynomial p of x is divided by x minus a, the remainder is p of a. The factor theorem states that x minus a is a factor of polynomial p of x if and only if p of a equals 0. These theorems connect factoring with function evaluation.",
        "intuition": "Think of polynomials as mathematical sentences built from simpler phrases (terms). Adding polynomials is like combining similar items: 3 apples plus 2 apples is 5 apples, just as 3x plus 2x is 5x. Factoring is like breaking a complex expression into simpler building blocks that multiply together. Finding roots is like detective work: you are searching for the secret values that make the whole expression vanish to zero.",

X squared terms: negative 3x squared plus 4x squared equals x squared. X terms: 0 minus 2x equals negative 2x. Constants: 5 plus 1 equals 6. Result: 3x cubed plus x squared minus 2x plus 6."},
            {"problem": "Multiply: x plus 4 times 2x minus 3.", "solution": "First: x times 2x equals 2x squared. Outer: x times negative 3 equals negative 3x. Inner: 4 times 2x equals 8x. Last: 4 times negative 3 equals negative 12. Combine: 2x squared plus 5x minus 12."},
            {"problem": "Factor completely: x squared minus 25.", "solution": "This is a difference of squares: x squared minus 5 squared. Using a squared minus b squared equals the quantity a plus b times the quantity a minus b, we get the quantity x plus 5 times the quantity x minus 5."},
            {"problem": "Solve: x squared minus 7x plus 10 equals 0.", "solution": "Factor: find numbers with product 10 and sum negative 7, which are negative 5 and negative 2. Factor: the quantity x minus 5 times the quantity x minus 2 equals 0. Set factors equal to zero: x minus 5 equals 0 gives x equals 5. X minus 2 equals 0 gives x equals 2. Solutions: x equals 5 and x equals 2."}

# Module 10: Inequalities
inequalities = {
    "module_id": "inequalities",
    "module_name": "Inequalities",
    "level": "beginner",
    "learning_objectives": ["Understand inequality notation and properties", "Solve linear inequalities in one variable", "Solve compound and absolute value inequalities", "Graph solution sets on number lines and coordinate planes"],
    "core_content": {
        "theory": "An inequality is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using inequality symbols. Unlike equations that state two expressions are equal, inequalities show that one expression is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another. The inequality symbols are: less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. For example, x greater than 5 means x is greater than 5. Y less than or equal to 10 means y is less than or equal to 10. Inequalities have many solutions, unlike equations that typically have specific solutions. For x greater than 3, any number larger than 3 is a solution: 4, 5, 3.1, 100, and so on. We can represent solutions on a number line. For x greater than 3, draw a number line, mark 3 with an open circle (since 3 is not included), and shade everything to the right. An open circle means the endpoint is not included. A closed circle means it is included. For x greater than or equal to 3, use a closed circle at 3. Properties of inequalities help solve them. The addition property states that adding or subtracting the same number to both sides preserves the inequality. If a less than b, then a plus c less than b plus c. For example, if x minus 4 less than 7, add 4 to both sides to get x less than 11. The multiplication property states that multiplying or dividing both sides by a positive number preserves the inequality. If a less than b and c greater than 0, then a times c less than b times c. However, multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality. If a less than b and c less than 0, then a times c greater than b times c. This is crucial: when you multiply or divide by a negative, flip the inequality sign. For example, solve negative 2x greater than 6. Divide both sides by negative 2, reversing the inequality: x less than negative 3. To solve linear inequalities, use similar steps as solving equations, but remember to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers. Example: solve 3x minus 5 less than or equal to 10. Add 5 to both sides: 3x less than or equal to 15. Divide by 3: x less than or equal to 5. Solution is all x less than or equal to 5, written in interval notation as negative infinity to 5 closed bracket. Compound inequalities involve two separate inequalities combined with and or or. An and compound inequality like a less than x and x less than b is often written as a less than x less than b, meaning x is between a and b. The solution is the intersection of the individual solutions. For example, negative 2 less than x less than or equal to 5 means x is greater than negative 2 and x is less than or equal to 5. On a number line, use an open circle at negative 2 and a closed circle at 5, shading between them. An or compound inequality means the solution satisfies at least one inequality. The solution is the union of individual solutions. For x less than 1 or x greater than or equal to 4, shade left of 1 (open circle) and right of 4 (closed circle). Absolute value inequalities involve the absolute value function. Recall the absolute value of x, written vertical bar x vertical bar, represents the distance of x from zero. The absolute value of x equals x if x greater than or equal to 0, and equals negative x if x less than 0. For absolute value less than inequalities: vertical bar x vertical bar less than a where a greater than 0 is equivalent to negative a less than x less than a. For example, vertical bar x vertical bar less than 3 means negative 3 less than x less than 3. For absolute value greater than inequalities: vertical bar x vertical bar greater than a where a greater than 0 is equivalent to x less than negative a or x greater than a. For example, vertical bar x vertical bar greater than 2 means x less than negative 2 or x greater than 2. More complex absolute value inequalities require isolating the absolute value first. Solve vertical bar 2x minus 1 vertical bar less than or equal to 5. This means negative 5 less than or equal to 2x minus 1 less than or equal to 5. Add 1 to all parts: negative 4 less than or equal to 2x less than or equal to 6. Divide by 2: negative 2 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 3. Graphing linear inequalities in two variables: an inequality like y greater than 2x plus 1 has infinitely many solutions that are ordered pairs. To graph, first graph the boundary line y equals 2x plus 1. Use a dashed line if the inequality is strict (greater than or less than) because points on the line are not solutions. Use a solid line for greater than or equal to or less than or equal to because points on the line are included. Then determine which side to shade by testing a point. The origin (0, 0) is convenient if not on the line. For y greater than 2x plus 1, test (0, 0): is 0 greater than 2 times 0 plus 1, is 0 greater than 1, which is false. So shade the side not containing (0, 0). Systems of inequalities involve finding solutions satisfying multiple inequalities simultaneously. Graph each inequality and find the overlapping shaded region. Interval notation is a compact way to write solution sets. Square brackets indicate inclusion, parentheses indicate exclusion. For x greater than or equal to 2, write 2 with square bracket to positive infinity with parenthesis. For negative 1 less than x less than 3, write parenthesis negative 1 comma 3 parenthesis.",
        "intuition": "Think of inequalities as describing ranges rather than exact values. Instead of saying you must be exactly 18 years old, an inequality might say you must be at least 18 or at most 65. On a number line, equations are single points, but inequalities are entire regions. Flipping the inequality when multiplying by a negative is like reversing perspective: if you have less money than me and we both get into debt (multiply by negative), now you actually have more debt (reverse the inequality).",

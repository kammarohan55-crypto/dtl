    "definition": "A variable in C is a named memory location that stores a value of a specific data type. Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold and the amount of memory allocated: `int` for integers (typically 4 bytes), `float` for single-precision floating-point numbers (4 bytes), `double` for double-precision (8 bytes), and `char` for single characters (1 byte). Variables must be declared before use, specifying type and name: `int age; float price; char grade;`",
    "concept_overview": [
        "Variables are declared with syntax: `datatype variable_name;` and optionally initialized: `datatype variable_name = value;`",
        "Fundamental data types: `int` (integers like 42), `float` (decimals like 3.14f), `char` (characters like 'A'), `double` (high-precision decimals).",
        "Type modifiers extend range/size: `short int` (2 bytes), `long int` (8 bytes), `unsigned int` (only positive), `signed int` (positive/negative).",
        "Memory size matters: `sizeof(datatype)` returns bytes allocated. Example: `sizeof(int)` usually returns 4 on modern systems.",
        "Variable scope determines visibility: local variables (inside functions, exist during function execution) vs global variables (outside functions, exist for program lifetime)."
    ],
    "theory": [
        "Variables form the fundamental building blocks of programs, providing named storage for data that changes during execution. Unlike constants which remain fixed, variables represent quantities that vary—user input, calculation results, loop counters, state information. The concept of typed variables reflects how computers physically store data: an integer uses fixed-point representation in twos-complement form, a float uses IEEE 754 floating-point format with sign, exponent, and mantissa, and a char stores ASCII or Unicode values. By declaring a variable with a specific type, you inform the compiler how much memory to allocate and how to interpret the bit pattern stored there. For example, the bit pattern 01000001 represents integer 65 if interpreted as `int`, but character 'A' if interpreted as `char`. Understanding variables and types is essential because all program data resides in variables—from simple counters to complex data structures. Memory management, a core C concept, begins with understanding how much space each variable requires and where it's allocated (stack for local variables, data segment for globals).",
        "The fundamental data types in C each serve specific purposes and have defined ranges. `int` stores whole numbers using typically 4 bytes (32 bits), representing values from approximately -2 billion to +2 billion (signed) or 0 to 4 billion (unsigned). `float` uses 4 bytes for approximate decimal numbers with ~7 significant digits precision, suitable for measurements where small errors are acceptable. `double` uses 8 bytes for ~15-16 significant digits, used when high precision is required (scientific calculations, financial computations). `char` uses 1 byte to store single characters using ASCII encoding ('A' = 65, 'a' = 97, '0' = 48). Type modifiers alter these defaults: `short int` reduces to 2 bytes, `long int` extends to 8 bytes, `unsigned` eliminates negative range to double positive range, and `signed` explicitly allows negative numbers. The `sizeof` operator returns the number of bytes a type occupies, which is implementation-dependent but standardized for portability. Variable declaration syntax follows `datatype identifier;` with identifier naming rules: must start with letter or underscore, can contain letters/digits/underscores, case-sensitive, and cannot be C keywords (int, float, if, while, etc.). Initialization assigns initial value: `int count = 0;` combines declaration and assignment.",
        "Mastery of variables and data types is critically important because proper type selection affects program correctness, efficiency, and portability. Choosing `int` when `long` is needed causes overflow errors when values exceed int's range. Using `float` for financial calculations introduces rounding errors that compound over operations. Declaring everything as `double` wastes memory in memory-constrained embedded systems. Understanding variable scope prevents bugs: local variables are automatically created when a function is called and destroyed when it returns, while globals persist for the program's lifetime but create coupling between functions. Type safety—the compiler's enforcement of type rules—catches errors like assigning a string to an integer at compile time rather than runtime. Modern embedded systems and IoT devices have limited RAM (kilobytes to megabytes), making careful type selection crucial. In safety-critical systems (automotive, medical devices), using unsigned types for quantities that cannot be negative prevents invalid states. Understanding how types map to hardware enables optimization: using `char` for small counts instead of `int` reduces memory footprint. In examinations, demonstrating proper type selection, correct syntax for declaration/initialization, and understanding of memory layout shows fundamental programming competence."

Computer memory stores bits (binary digits), but interpreting those bits requires context. A 32-bit value could represent an integer, floating-point number, four characters, or an address. By declaring types, we tell the compiler how to interpret and manipulate these bits. Integer arithmetic uses ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) integer operations; floating-point uses FPU (Floating Point Unit) with different circuitry. Using the smallest type that fits the data range minimizes memory usage: if a counter only goes 0-100, `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) suffices instead of `int` (4 bytes). This matters in arrays: 1000 integers need 4KB, but 1000 chars need only 1KB. The type system also provides safety: attempting to assign incompatible types generates warnings, catching logic errors early.",

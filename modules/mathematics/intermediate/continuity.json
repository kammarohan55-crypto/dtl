    "definition": "A function $f(x)$ is continuous at a point $x = a$ if three conditions are satisfied: (1) $f(a)$ exists, (2) $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ exists, and (3) $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$. A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. Intuitively, a function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.",
    "concept_overview": [
        "Continuity ensures that small changes in input produce small changes in output, with no sudden jumps or breaks in the function.",
        "The three-part definition requires existence of the function value, existence of the limit, and equality between them.",
        "Discontinuities are classified as removable (can be fixed by redefining one point), jump (left and right limits exist but differ), or infinite (limit approaches infinity).",
        "The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function on $[a,b]$ takes on every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.",
        "Continuous functions possess important properties: sums, products, quotients, and compositions of continuous functions remain continuous (with appropriate domain restrictions)."
    ],
    "theory": [
        "Continuity represents a fundamental property of functions that ensures predictable, uninterrupted behavior essential for modeling physical systems and enabling calculus operations. While the intuitive notion of continuity as 'no breaks in the graph' suffices for visualization, the rigorous epsilon-delta definition provides the mathematical precision necessary for theoretical proofs and advanced analysis. Historically, the formalization of continuity resolved paradoxes in infinitesimal calculus and established calculus on solid logical foundations. In engineering applications, continuity assumptions underpin virtually all mathematical models: electrical signals are modeled as continuous functions, stress distributions in materials are assumed continuous except at boundaries, and control system responses are analyzed assuming continuous state variables. The study of continuity develops essential analytical skills including precise reasoning about function behavior, identifying and classifying singularities, and understanding the implications of mathematical assumptions on physical validity. Mastery of continuity provides the theoretical foundation for differentiability, integrability, and all subsequent analysis in engineering mathematics.",
        "The fundamental definition of continuity at a point $x = a$ requires three conditions to hold simultaneously. First, $f(a)$ must exist—the function must be defined at the point. Second, $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ must exist—the function must approach a definite value as $x$ approaches $a$ from both sides. Third, these two values must be equal: $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$—the limit value must match the function value. Failure of any condition creates a discontinuity. When $f(a)$ is undefined but the limit exists, we have a removable discontinuity that can be eliminated by defining $f(a)$ to equal the limit. When both one-sided limits exist but differ, we have a jump discontinuity where the function 'jumps' from one value to another. When the limit approaches infinity, we have an infinite discontinuity or vertical asymptote. Piecewise functions require careful analysis at boundary points where the definition changes. Polynomial, rational (except at denominator zeros), exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are continuous on their natural domains. Compositions and arithmetic combinations of continuous functions preserve continuity: if $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$, then $f+g$, $f \\cdot g$, $f/g$ (if $g(a) \\neq 0$), and $f \\circ g$ are continuous at $a$.",
        "Mastery of continuity is critically important because it provides the prerequisite for differentiation and integration, and ensures mathematical models accurately represent physical reality. The Intermediate Value Theorem, guaranteed only for continuous functions, enables proving existence of solutions without explicitly finding them—essential in numerical analysis and root-finding algorithms. In engineering, continuity assumptions enable application of powerful analytical techniques: differential equations require continuous coefficients for solution existence theorems, Laplace transforms assume piecewise continuous functions, and Fourier analysis relies on continuity for convergence. Discontinuities in physical systems often indicate idealized models: instantaneous switches in circuits create discontinuous voltage signals, material interfaces produce discontinuous stress fields, and shock waves in fluids represent discontinuous pressure and density. Identifying whether discontinuities are inherent to the physical system or artifacts of mathematical idealization is crucial for model validity. The differentiability of continuous functions depends critically on smoothness—mere continuity is insufficient; the function must also have no sharp corners. In control systems, continuous feedback ensures smooth actuator response. In signal processing, continuous-time signals model analog systems while discontinuous signals represent digital or sampled systems. In examinations, proficiency in analyzing continuity demonstrates understanding of function behavior, ability to apply definitions rigorously, and skill in identifying and classifying singularities in mathematical models."

By continuity of $f$ at $c$, for $\\epsilon = k - f(c) > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon$ for $|x - c| < \\delta$. This means $f(x) < f(c) + \\epsilon = k$ for all $x$ in $(c - \\delta, c + \\delta)$. Thus points to the right of $c$ are in $S$, contradicting $c$ being the supremum. Similarly, supposing $f(c) > k$ leads to a contradiction. Therefore $f(c) = k$, and $c \\in (a,b)$ since $f(a) < k < f(b)$.

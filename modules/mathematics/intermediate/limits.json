Formally, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - a| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$. The limit exists and equals $L$ only if both left-hand limit and right-hand limit equal $L$.",

    ],
    "theory": [
        "Limits constitute the foundational concept of calculus, providing the rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing rates of change, instantaneous velocity, and area under curves. Historically developed to resolve paradoxes of motion and infinitesimals, limits formalize the intuitive notion of approaching a value without necessarily reaching it. The epsilon-delta definition, though technically demanding, ensures mathematical precision and enables rigorous proofs of calculus theorems. In engineering education, limits appear when analyzing circuit behavior as frequency approaches infinity or zero, computing instantaneous rates in chemical kinetics, determining stability boundaries in control systems, and evaluating stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities. The study of limits develops critical analytical skills including precise reasoning with infinitesimal quantities, handling edge cases and special behaviors, and building mathematical intuition for the behavior of complex functions. Mastery of limits provides the essential conceptual foundation for differentiation, integration, infinite series, and all subsequent calculus-based engineering analysis.",
        "The fundamental techniques for evaluating limits exploit algebraic manipulation and theoretical properties to transform indeterminate forms into determinate ones. Direct substitution works when $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = a$: simply evaluate $f(a)$. When direct substitution yields an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$, algebraic techniques apply: factorization cancels common factors in rational functions, rationalization removes radicals from numerators or denominators, and expansion uses binomial or trigonometric identities. L'Hôpital's rule handles indeterminate forms $\\frac{0}{0}$ and $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$ by replacing the original limit with the limit of the ratio of derivatives: if $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{0}{0}$ or $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$, then $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ provided the latter limit exists. Other indeterminate forms like $0 \\cdot \\infty$, $\\infty - \\infty$, $0^0$, $1^\\infty$, and $\\infty^0$ require transformation into $\\frac{0}{0}$ or $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$ forms. One-sided limits examine behavior approaching from one direction: $\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x)$ as $x$ approaches from the right and $\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x)$ from the left. The two-sided limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal.",
        "Mastery of limits is critically important because they provide the rigorous foundation upon which all of calculus and its engineering applications rest. The derivative, defined as $f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$, requires understanding limits to compute instantaneous rates of change. The definite integral, defined as a limit of Riemann sums, requires limits to transition from finite approximations to exact areas. In engineering problem-solving, limits model asymptotic behavior: amplifier gain as frequency approaches infinity, chemical reaction rates as concentration approaches zero, and structural deflection as load approaches critical buckling values. Limits enable analysis of discontinuities and singularities that appear at material interfaces, geometric transitions, and boundary conditions. The concept of a limit teaches engineers to reason about limiting cases, extreme conditions, and threshold behaviors—essential skills for design, safety analysis, and performance optimization. In control systems, limits determine stability margins and steady-state errors. In signal processing, limits describe filter behavior at cutoff frequencies. In examinations, proficiency in computing limits demonstrates command over algebraic manipulation, strategic use of limit laws, and the ability to recognize and resolve indeterminate forms through appropriate techniques."

Consider the limit $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$. By the definition of the derivative, we can write $f(x) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) = f'(a)(x-a)$ for $x$ near $a$ (since $f(a) = 0$).

    "definition": "A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. A solution to the system is a set of values for the variables that simultaneously satisfies all equations in the system. A system of $m$ equations in $n$ variables can be written as $a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1$, $a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2$, ..., $a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \\cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m$, or in matrix form as $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$.",
    "concept_overview": [
        "Systems are classified by solution existence: consistent systems have at least one solution, while inconsistent systems have no solution.",
        "Consistent systems are further classified as independent (unique solution) or dependent (infinitely many solutions forming a line or plane).",
        "Common solution methods include substitution (solving one equation for a variable and substituting), elimination (adding/subtracting equations to eliminate variables), and matrix methods.",
        "The coefficient matrix $A$ and augmented matrix $[A|\\mathbf{b}]$ provide compact notation, with solutions dependent on their ranks and determinants.",
        "For a square system ($n$ equations in $n$ unknowns), Cramer's rule expresses each variable as a ratio of determinants, valid when $\\det(A) \\neq 0$."
    ],
    "theory": [
        "Systems of linear equations constitute the most fundamental problem in linear algebra and appear ubiquitously in engineering analysis wherever multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously. Historically, systematic methods for solving linear systems date back to ancient Chinese mathematics, but modern matrix formulation provides a unified framework applicable to systems of arbitrary size. In engineering practice, systems of linear equations model circuit networks (Kirchhoff's laws), structural analysis (equilibrium equations), chemical processes (mass balance), economic systems (input-output models), and optimization (linear programming constraints). The study of linear systems develops essential skills in systematic problem-solving, understanding solution existence and uniqueness, and translating physical constraints into mathematical form. Mastery of solution techniques for linear systems provides the foundation for numerical methods, least squares approximation, eigenvalue problems, and virtually all computational mathematics used in engineering applications.",
        "The fundamental solution methods for linear systems exploit algebraic manipulation to reduce complexity systematically. The substitution method solves one equation for a variable in terms of others, then substitutes this expression into remaining equations, reducing the system size by one. The elimination method (Gaussian elimination) adds appropriate multiples of equations to others to create zeros in the coefficient matrix, transforming the system into triangular form amenable to back-substitution. For systems in matrix form $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ square matrix, solution existence and uniqueness depend critically on the determinant: when $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the system has a unique solution $\\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$; when $\\det(A) = 0$, the system either has no solution (inconsistent) or infinitely many solutions (dependent). Cramer's rule provides explicit formulas for each variable: $x_i = \\frac{\\det(A_i)}{\\det(A)}$ where $A_i$ is the matrix $A$ with column $i$ replaced by $\\mathbf{b}$. While computationally expensive for large systems, Cramer's rule is valuable for theoretical analysis and understanding parametric dependencies. For non-square systems or when $\\det(A) = 0$, rank analysis using row reduction determines solution structure: the system is consistent if and only if $\\text{rank}(A) = \\text{rank}([A|\\mathbf{b}])$.",
        "Mastery of systems of linear equations is critically important because they provide the mathematical framework for virtually all multi-variable engineering problems. In electrical engineering, mesh analysis and nodal analysis produce linear systems relating voltages and currents throughout a circuit network. In structural mechanics, the stiffness method assembles global equilibrium equations $K\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f}$ where solving for displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$ requires solving a linear system potentially involving thousands of equations in finite element analysis. Control system state-space models lead to linear systems when computing equilibrium points and steady-state responses. Chemical process engineers solve material and energy balance equations formulated as linear systems. The distinction between consistent and inconsistent systems has profound practical significance: inconsistency indicates conflicting constraints or modeling errors, while dependence indicates redundant equations or insufficient constraints. The ability to classify solution types using determinants and rank provides engineers with diagnostic tools for troubleshooting models. In examinations and professional practice, proficiency in solving linear systems demonstrates command over systematic algebraic manipulation, matrix operations, and the ability to select appropriate solution methods based on problem structure and size."

This gives the system $ax + by = e$ and $cx + dy = f$. Multiplying the first equation by $d$ and the second by $b$ yields $adx + bdy = ed$ and $bcx + bdy = fb$. Subtracting eliminates $y$: $(ad - bc)x = ed - fb$. Since $\\det(A) = ad - bc$, we get $x = \\frac{ed - fb}{ad - bc}$. Observe that the numerator $ed - fb = \\begin{vmatrix} e & b \\\\ f & d \\end{vmatrix} = \\det(A_x)$ where $A_x$ has the $\\mathbf{b}$ vector replacing the first column.

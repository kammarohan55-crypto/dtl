    "definition": "A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of all possible values of a random variable. For discrete random variables, the binomial distribution models the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability $p$: $P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$. For continuous random variables, the normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ has PDF $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/(2\\sigma^2)}$, describing many natural phenomena.",

        "Uniform distribution assigns equal probability density to all values in an interval $[a, b]$.",
        "Exponential distribution models time between events in a Poisson process, memoryless property.",

        "Probability distributions provide standardized mathematical models for random phenomena, enabling engineers to predict system behavior, assess risks, and make data-driven decisions without deriving distributions from first principles every time. Discrete distributions model count data (number of arrivals, defects, successes), while continuous distributions model measurements (lifetimes, dimensions, temperatures). These distributions arise naturally from physical processes: the binomial from independent trials, the Poisson from rare events, the exponential from memoryless waiting times, and the normal from aggregation of many small independent effects. In engineering applications, the binomial models component reliability in redundant systems, the Poisson models network packet arrivals, the exponential models electronic component failure times, and the normal models measurement errors and manufacturing tolerances. The study of probability distributions develops essential skills in model selection, parameter estimation, and using distribution properties to simplify complex calculations. Mastery of standard distributions provides the foundation for statistical inference, quality control, reliability theory, and queueing systems.",
        "The fundamental distributions each have characteristic formulas, parameters, and properties. The binomial distribution $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ has PMF $P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$, with $E[X] = np$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$. The Poisson distribution $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ has PMF $P(X = k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, with $E[X] = \\text{Var}(X) = \\lambda$, useful when $n$ is large and $p$ is small in binomial. The uniform distribution $X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(a, b)$ has PDF $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a \\leq x \\leq b$, with $E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2}$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$. The exponential distribution $X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$ has PDF $f(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}$ for $x \\geq 0$, with $E[X] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}$, exhibiting the memoryless property $P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t)$. The normal distribution $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ has PDF $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/(2\\sigma^2)}$, symmetric and bell-shaped, with $E[X] = \\mu$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$. The standard normal $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$ enables probability calculations via $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. The Central Limit Theorem states that sums or averages of independent random variables approach normal distribution regardless of original distribution, explaining the ubiquity of the normal.",
        "Mastery of probability distributions is critically important because they provide the standard models that engineers use to analyze systems involving randomness and make quantitative predictions. In reliability engineering, exponential and Weibull distributions model component lifetimes, enabling calculation of mean time to failure and failure rates. In quality control, normal distributions model process output, enabling determination of defect rates and process capability indices. In communications, Poisson processes model packet arrivals, enabling network capacity planning. The ability to recognize which distribution applies to a given scenario—based on physical properties like independence, memorylessness, or central limit behavior—is a key engineering skill. Parameters must be estimated from data or specified from physical considerations. Distribution properties enable shortcuts: using $E[X] = np$ for binomial avoids summing infinite series, and the 68-95-99.7 rule for normal enables quick probability estimates. The Central Limit Theorem provides theoretical justification for using normal approximations in diverse contexts, from estimating measurement error to analyzing sample means. In examinations and professional practice, proficiency demonstrates command over model selection, parameter interpretation, probability calculation using formulas and tables, and application of distributions to engineering problems."

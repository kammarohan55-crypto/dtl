    "definition": "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI enabling systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming. Instead of coding rules, ML algorithms discover patterns in data. Types: Supervised (learns from labeled examples: input-output pairs), Unsupervised (finds patterns in unlabeled data), Reinforcement (learns through trial-and-error with rewards). ML workflow: collect data → preprocess (clean, transform) → split (train/test sets) → train model → evaluate performance → deploy. Key concepts: Features (input variables), Labels (outputs in supervised learning), Model (learned function mapping inputs to outputs), Training (learning from data), Generalization (performing well on new unseen data). Tasks: Classification (predicting category), Regression (predicting continuous value).",

    "theory": [
        "Machine Learning revolutionized AI by shifting from hand-coded rules to learning from data. Traditional programming: expert encodes rules (IF symptoms THEN diagnosis)—brittle, doesn't adapt. ML: provide examples (symptom patterns + diagnoses), algorithm learns patterns automatically—generalizes to new cases. This paradigm enables tackling problems where rules are unknown (image recognition—no one can articulate pixel rules for 'cat'), too complex (language understanding), or change over time (stock prediction, user preferences). Understanding ML develops data-driven thinking: problems become learning tasks, solutions emerge from data rather than explicit logic. The ML mindset recognizes that sufficient quality data + appropriate algorithm often outperforms expert-coded heuristics. This drives modern AI successes: computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing all leverage ML learning representations from massive datasets rather than hand-engineered features.",
        "The fundamental ML types reflect different learning scenarios. Supervised Learning: algorithm learns from labeled training data—pairs (x, y) where x=input features, y=output label. Goal: learn function f: X→Y predicting y for new x. Examples: spam detection (x=email text, y=spam/not spam), house price prediction (x=size/location/features, y=price), image classification (x=pixels, y=object class). Algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks. Unsupervised Learning: no labels, algorithm finds structure in data. Clustering (group similar items): customer segmentation, document organization. Dimensionality reduction (compress high-dimensional data): visualization, noise reduction. Algorithms: K-means, hierarchical clustering, PCA. Reinforcement Learning: agent interacts with environment, learns through trial-and-error receiving rewards. Example: game playing (AlphaGo), robot control, recommendation systems. Algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients. ML workflow systematic: (1) Data collection—gather training examples; quality/quantity crucial. (2) Preprocessing—clean (handle missing/outliers), transform (normalize, encode categories), feature engineering (create useful features). (3) Split—divide data into training (learn), validation (tune), test (final evaluation) sets. (4) Model selection—choose algorithm family. (5) Training—optimize model parameters minimizing error on training data. (6) Evaluation—measure performance on test set (unseen data) using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE). (7) Deployment—use model in production. Key ML concepts: Features (attributes/variables describing examples—like 'size', 'location' for houses), Labels (ground truth outputs for supervised learning), Model (mathematical function with parameters learned from data), Hypothesis space (all possible functions model can represent), Overfitting (model memorizes training data, poor generalization), Underfitting (model too simple, high error), Generalization (crucial—performance on new data, not just training), Bias-variance tradeoff (balancing model complexity).",
        "Mastery of ML fundamentals is critically important as ML transforms industries: healthcare (disease diagnosis from medical images), finance (fraud detection, credit scoring), retail (personalized recommendations), autonomous vehicles (perception, decision-making), entertainment (content suggestions), manufacturing (predictive maintenance). Understanding ML workflow enables tackling real problems: defining task (classification vs regression), collecting/preprocessing data (garbage in→garbage out), selecting models, evaluating properly (avoiding overfitting illusion). Challenges: data quality (noisy, biased, insufficient labels), feature engineering (domain knowledge extracting useful features), model selection (right algorithm for task), evaluation (proper train/test split, appropriate metrics), deployment (scalability, monitoring). Common pitfalls: training on test data (overly optimistic results), class imbalance (99% accuracy meaningless if predicting rare events by always predicting majority), correlation≠causation (ML finds correlations; interpreting as causal dangerous), bias amplification (biased training data → biased predictions). Ethical considerations: fairness (avoiding discrimination), transparency (explainable predictions), privacy (protecting training data). ML limitations: requires large labeled datasets (expensive for supervised learning), struggles with small data, vulnerable to adversarial examples, lacks common sense/causality, opaque decisions (black-box models). Modern trends: deep learning (neural networks with many layers—image/speech/NLP breakthroughs), transfer learning (reusing pre-trained models), few-shot learning (learning from few examples), explainable AI (interpreting model decisions). In examinations, demonstrating ML type classification, workflow understanding, task identification (classification/regression), and awareness of generalization/overfitting shows foundational ML competence for further study."

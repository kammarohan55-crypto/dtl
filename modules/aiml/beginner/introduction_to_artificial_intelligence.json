    "definition": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence—such as reasoning, learning, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI encompasses multiple approaches: symbolic AI (rule-based reasoning), connectionist AI (neural networks), and hybrid methods. Goals include building intelligent agents that perceive environments and take actions to maximize success. AI applications span computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, expert systems, and game playing. The field intersects mathematics, neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.",

    "theory": [
        "Artificial Intelligence emerged from the ambitious goal of replicating human intelligence in machines. The foundational question—'Can machines think?'—drove pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test: if a machine's responses in conversation are indistinguishable from a human's, it exhibits intelligence. This behavioral definition sidesteps philosophical debates about consciousness, focusing on observable capabilities. AI's interdisciplinary roots draw from mathematics (logic, probability, optimization), neuroscience (brain-inspired architectures), psychology (cognitive models), linguistics (language understanding), and philosophy (nature of intelligence). Early AI optimism in the 1960s expected human-level AI within decades, but challenges like computational limits and knowledge representation led to 'AI winters' (funding cuts, reduced interest). Breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning since 2010s—powered by big data, GPU computing, and algorithmic advances—revitalized the field, achieving superhuman performance in narrow domains (image recognition, game playing).",
        "The fundamental approaches to AI reflect different philosophies about intelligence. Symbolic AI (classical/GOFAI—Good Old-Fashioned AI) represents knowledge using symbols, rules, and logic: expert systems encode domain knowledge as if-then rules (e.g., medical diagnosis systems), planning systems use logical reasoning to achieve goals. This approach dominated early AI but struggled with common-sense reasoning and learning from raw data. Connectionist AI (neural networks) mimics brain structure: interconnected neurons learn patterns from data through training. Deep learning, using multi-layer neural networks, excels at perception tasks (vision, speech) by learning hierarchical representations. Hybrid approaches combine symbolic reasoning with connectionist learning, leveraging strengths of both. The AI hierarchy clarifies relationships: AI is the overarching field, Machine Learning is a subset enabling systems to learn without explicit programming, Deep Learning is a further subset using deep neural networks. Modern AI often employs ML/DL for perception and learning, symbolic methods for reasoning and explainability. Applications demonstrate AI impact: computer vision (facial recognition, autonomous driving), NLP (language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots), robotics (warehouse automation, surgical robots), recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), game AI (AlphaGo defeating world champions). Weak AI (narrow AI) excels at specific tasks but lacks general intelligence; Strong AI (AGI—Artificial General Intelligence) would match human cognitive abilities across domains, remaining a long-term research goal.",
        "Mastery of AI fundamentals is critically important as AI permeates society—autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, financial trading, personalized education, content moderation. Understanding AI enables informed decisions about adoption, regulation, and ethics. Key concepts: intelligence isn't monolithic—AI systems excel in narrow domains but lack human flexibility. Learning from data enables adaptation but requires quality datasets and computational resources. Bias in training data propagates to AI decisions, raising fairness concerns (biased hiring algorithms, facial recognition accuracy disparities). Explainability challenges: deep learning models are 'black boxes'—difficult to interpret decisions, critical in healthcare, legal contexts. Safety and alignment: ensuring AI systems behave as intended, especially as capabilities increase (autonomous weapons, deepfakes). Job displacement: automation affects employment, requiring workforce adaptation. Privacy: AI systems analyzing personal data raise surveillance concerns. Environmental impact: training large models consumes significant energy. Ethical frameworks guide responsible AI: transparency (how decisions are made), accountability (who is responsible), fairness (avoiding discrimination), safety (preventing harm). AI limitations: lacks common sense, struggles with causality (correlation vs causation), requires large labeled datasets (data-hungry), vulnerable to adversarial examples (small input perturbations causing failures). Future AI research addresses general intelligence, few-shot learning (learning from fewer examples), explainable AI, robust safety mechanisms. In examinations, demonstrating understanding of AI definitions, approaches, applications, limitations, and ethical considerations shows foundational AI literacy essential for further study."

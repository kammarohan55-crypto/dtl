                        "theory": "Number systems form the foundation of all mathematics. Understanding numbers is essential for every mathematical operation and concept you will encounter. Let us begin with the most basic concept of counting. When humans first started counting objects, they used their fingers, pebbles, or marks on walls. This led to the development of natural numbers. Natural numbers are the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. These are the numbers we use in everyday life when we count apples, books, or people. Natural numbers start from 1 and go on indefinitely. There is no largest natural number. We denote the set of natural numbers by the symbol N. So N equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and continuing forever. Notice that zero is not included in natural numbers because you cannot count zero objects in the traditional sense. Natural numbers have several important properties. When you add two natural numbers, you always get another natural number. When you multiply two natural numbers, you get another natural number. However, when you subtract or divide natural numbers, you might not always get a natural number. For example, 3 minus 5 does not give a natural number, and 7 divided by 2 does not give a natural number. This limitation led to the expansion of our number system. The next level is whole numbers. Whole numbers include all natural numbers plus zero. So the set of whole numbers W equals the set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and continuing forever. The addition of zero was crucial because it represents the absence of quantity, which is an important concept. Zero allows us to perform operations like 5 minus 5 equals 0. Whole numbers are closed under addition and multiplication, meaning when you add or multiply two whole numbers, you get another whole number. However, whole numbers still have limitations with subtraction. What happens when you need to calculate 3 minus 7? This gives negative 4, which is not a whole number. This need led to the development of integers. Integers include all positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. The set of integers Z contains negative infinity, going through negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and continuing to positive infinity. Integers are extremely useful in real life. Temperature can be below zero degrees, bank accounts can have negative balances representing debt, and elevation can be below sea level. Integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. When you add, subtract, or multiply any two integers, you always get another integer. However, division still presents challenges. For example, 7 divided by 2 equals 3.5, which is not an integer. This limitation brings us to rational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction p divided by q, where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero. The word rational comes from ratio. Examples of rational numbers include one half, negative three fourths, 5 (which can be written as 5 divided by 1), 0 (which can be written as 0 divided by 1), and 0.75 (which equals three fourths). We denote the set of rational numbers by Q. Every integer is a rational number because any integer n can be written as n divided by 1. Every terminating decimal is a rational number. For example, 0.25 equals 25 divided by 100, which simplifies to one fourth. Every repeating decimal is also a rational number. For instance, 0.333... (where 3 repeats forever) equals one third. Rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by zero). This means when you perform these operations on rational numbers, you always get another rational number. Rational numbers fill many gaps on the number line, but remarkably, there are still numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions. These are called irrational numbers. Irrational numbers cannot be written as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal representations neither terminate nor repeat. The most famous irrational number is pi, approximately 3.14159..., which represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Another important irrational number is the square root of 2, approximately 1.41421... The ancient Greeks discovered that the square root of 2 cannot be expressed as a fraction, which was a shocking revelation at the time. Other examples of irrational numbers include the square root of 3, the square root of 5, the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828...), and the golden ratio phi (approximately 1.61803...). When we combine rational numbers and irrational numbers, we get real numbers. The set of real numbers R includes all numbers that can be located on the number line. Real numbers include all rational numbers (integers, fractions, terminating decimals, repeating decimals) and all irrational numbers (non-terminating, non-repeating decimals). The real number line is a continuous line where every point represents a real number. Between any two real numbers, there are infinitely many other real numbers. Real numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by zero). Understanding the hierarchy of number systems is crucial. Natural numbers are a subset of whole numbers. Whole numbers are a subset of integers. Integers are a subset of rational numbers. Rational numbers are a subset of real numbers. We can visualize this as nested sets, where each larger set contains all the previous ones. Let us now discuss the properties of operations on these number systems. The commutative property states that the order of numbers does not matter in addition and multiplication. For any numbers a and b, a plus b equals b plus a, and a times b equals b times a. For example, 3 plus 5 equals 5 plus 3, both equal 8. Similarly, 4 times 7 equals 7 times 4, both equal 28. The associative property states that when adding or multiplying three or more numbers, the grouping does not matter. For any numbers a, b, and c, the quantity a plus b all grouped, then plus c, equals a plus the quantity b plus c all grouped. The same applies to multiplication. For example, the quantity 2 plus 3 grouped, then plus 4, equals 5 plus 4 equals 9. Also, 2 plus the quantity 3 plus 4 grouped equals 2 plus 7 equals 9. The distributive property connects multiplication and addition. For any numbers a, b, and c, a times the quantity b plus c equals a times b plus a times c. For example, 3 times the quantity 4 plus 5 equals 3 times 4 plus 3 times 5 equals 12 plus 15 equals 27. We can verify this: 3 times 9 equals 27. The identity property states that there are special numbers that do not change other numbers when used in operations. For addition, the identity is 0 because a plus 0 equals a for any number a. For multiplication, the identity is 1 because a times 1 equals a for any number a. The inverse property states that every number has an opposite. For addition, the additive inverse of a is negative a because a plus negative a equals 0. For multiplication, the multiplicative inverse of a (where a is not zero) is 1 divided by a because a times 1 divided by a equals 1. Converting between decimal and fraction forms is an important skill. To convert a terminating decimal to a fraction, count the number of decimal places, write the digits as the numerator, and use a denominator that is 1 followed by that many zeros, then simplify. For example, 0.75 has two decimal places, so write 75 over 100, which simplifies to 3 over 4. To convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, use algebraic techniques. Let x equal the repeating decimal. Multiply both sides by a power of 10 to shift the decimal point. Subtract the original equation from this new equation to eliminate the repeating part. Solve for x. For example, let x equal 0.666... Then 10x equals 6.666... Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 9x equals 6, so x equals 6 over 9, which simplifies to 2 over 3.",
                        "intuition": "Think of number systems as expanding circles. We started with natural numbers because we needed to count things. Then we added zero because we needed to represent nothing. Then we added negative numbers because we needed to represent debt or temperatures below zero. Then we added fractions because we needed to split things into parts. Finally, we discovered irrational numbers when we realized some lengths, like the diagonal of a square, cannot be expressed as fractions. Each expansion of the number system was driven by practical needs and mathematical discoveries.",

                        "theory": "A linear equation is one of the most fundamental concepts in algebra and mathematics. Before we define what a linear equation is, let us understand what an equation means. An equation is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal, connected by an equals sign. For example, 2x plus 3 equals 7 is an equation. An equation contains variables (letters that represent unknown numbers) and constants (known numbers). Now, what makes an equation linear? A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. The variable appears only to the first power, never squared, cubed, or any higher power. Additionally, variables in linear equations are not in denominators, under square roots, or inside other functions. The simplest form of a linear equation in one variable is ax plus b equals 0, where a and b are constants and a is not equal to zero. Examples of linear equations in one variable include: x plus 5 equals 12, 3y minus 7 equals 20, 2z equals 10, and 4p plus 3 equals 2p minus 5. Examples of equations that are NOT linear include: x squared plus 5 equals 12 (the variable is squared), 1 divided by x equals 3 (variable in denominator), and the square root of x equals 4 (variable under a radical). To solve a linear equation means to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. This value is called the solution or root of the equation. Let us learn the systematic method for solving linear equations in one variable. The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We do this by performing inverse operations while maintaining equality. The fundamental principle is that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side. This keeps the equation balanced. Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation. Remove parentheses using the distributive property if necessary. Combine like terms on each side. Step 2: Move all terms containing the variable to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. Use addition or subtraction to move terms. Remember that moving a term across the equals sign changes its sign. Step 3: Combine like terms again if needed. Step 4: Divide or multiply both sides by the coefficient of the variable to isolate the variable. Step 5: Check your solution by substituting it back into the original equation. Let us work through a detailed example. Solve the equation 3x plus 7 equals 22. Step 1: The equation is already simplified. Step 2: Subtract 7 from both sides to move the constant to the right side. This gives 3x plus 7 minus 7 equals 22 minus 7, which simplifies to 3x equals 15. Step 3: No like terms to combine. Step 4: Divide both sides by 3 to isolate x. This gives 3x divided by 3 equals 15 divided by 3, which simplifies to x equals 5. Step 5: Check by substituting x equals 5 into the original equation. We get 3 times 5 plus 7 equals 15 plus 7 equals 22, which equals the right side. The solution is verified. Therefore, x equals 5. Now let us consider a more complex example with variables on both sides. Solve 5x minus 3 equals 2x plus 9. Step 1: Both sides are simplified. Step 2: Move all x terms to the left and constants to the right. Subtract 2x from both sides: 5x minus 2x minus 3 equals 2x minus 2x plus 9, giving 3x minus 3 equals 9. Now add 3 to both sides: 3x minus 3 plus 3 equals 9 plus 3, giving 3x equals 12. Step 4: Divide both sides by 3: x equals 4. Step 5: Check: 5 times 4 minus 3 equals 20 minus 3 equals 17. Also, 2 times 4 plus 9 equals 8 plus 9 equals 17. Both sides equal, so x equals 4 is correct. Some linear equations have fractions. When dealing with fractional equations, it is often easier to multiply the entire equation by the least common multiple of all denominators to clear the fractions. For example, solve x over 2 plus 3 equals x over 3 plus 5. The denominators are 2 and 3, and their LCM is 6. Multiply every term by 6: 6 times x over 2 plus 6 times 3 equals 6 times x over 3 plus 6 times 5. This simplifies to 3x plus 18 equals 2x plus 30. Subtracting 2x from both sides gives x plus 18 equals 30. Subtracting 18 from both sides gives x equals 12. Linear equations also appear in the form of word problems. The key to solving word problems is to translate the written information into a mathematical equation. Step 1: Read the problem carefully and identify what you need to find. Assign a variable to the unknown quantity. Step 2: Identify the relationships and conditions given in the problem. Step 3: Write an equation based on these relationships. Step 4: Solve the equation. Step 5: Answer the question in words and check if the answer makes sense. Let us solve a word problem. The sum of a number and 12 is 35. Find the number. Step 1: Let x be the unknown number. Step 2: The sum of x and 12 is 35. Step 3: Write the equation: x plus 12 equals 35. Step 4: Solve by subtracting 12 from both sides: x equals 23. Step 5: The number is 23. Check: 23 plus 12 equals 35, which is correct. Another example: Five times a number decreased by 7 equals three times the same number increased by 9. Find the number. Let x be the number. Five times the number is 5x. Decreased by 7 means minus 7, so we have 5x minus 7. Three times the number is 3x. Increased by 9 means plus 9, giving 3x plus 9. The equation is 5x minus 7 equals 3x plus 9. Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x minus 7 equals 9. Add 7 to both sides: 2x equals 16. Divide by 2: x equals 8. The number is 8. Check: 5 times 8 minus 7 equals 40 minus 7 equals 33. Also, 3 times 8 plus 9 equals 24 plus 9 equals 33. Verified. Now let us extend to linear equations in two variables. A linear equation in two variables has the form ax plus by equals c, where a, b, and c are constants and a and b are not both zero. The variables are typically x and y. Examples include x plus y equals 5, 2x minus 3y equals 6, and y equals 2x plus 1. Unlike equations in one variable which have one solution, linear equations in two variables have infinitely many solutions. Each solution is an ordered pair of values for x and y. For example, for the equation x plus y equals 5, some solutions are x equals 0 and y equals 5, written as the ordered pair (0, 5), also (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), and infinitely many others including non-integer solutions like (1.5, 3.5). The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line in the coordinate plane. Every point on this line represents a solution to the equation. To graph a linear equation, find at least two points that satisfy the equation and draw a line through them. The most common form for graphing is the slope-intercept form: y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis). To convert an equation like 2x plus y equals 4 into slope-intercept form, solve for y: y equals negative 2x plus 4. The slope is negative 2 and the y-intercept is 4. The slope indicates the steepness and direction of the line. A positive slope means the line rises from left to right. A negative slope means the line falls from left to right. A slope of zero means a horizontal line. An undefined slope corresponds to a vertical line. The slope can be calculated as the change in y divided by the change in x, often remembered as rise over run. If you have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope m equals y2 minus y1 all divided by x2 minus x1.",
                        "intuition": "Think of a linear equation as a balance scale. Whatever is on the left side must equal what is on the right side. When you solve an equation, you are trying to find what weight (value) the unknown variable must have to keep the scale balanced.

For equations in two variables, imagine every solution as a point in space, and when you connect all these points, they form a straight line, which is why we call them linear equations.",

Subtract 5x from both sides: 8x minus 5x minus 12 equals 9, giving 3x minus 12 equals 9. Add 12 to both sides: 3x equals 21. Divide both sides by 3: x equals 7. Check: Left side is 4(2 times 7 minus 3) equals 4(14 minus 3) equals 4(11) equals 44. Right side is 5 times 7 plus 9 equals 35 plus 9 equals 44. Both sides equal, so x equals 7 is correct."

                        "theory": "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols, usually letters, to represent numbers in expressions and equations. An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables, and operation symbols. Unlike equations, expressions do not have an equals sign. They represent a value but do not make a statement of equality. For example, 3x plus 5, 2a squared minus 7b, and 4xy divided by 3 are all algebraic expressions. Let us understand the components of algebraic expressions. A variable is a symbol, typically a letter like x, y, or z, that represents an unknown or changing quantity. A constant is a fixed numerical value, such as 3, negative 5, or one half. A coefficient is the numerical factor that multiplies a variable. In the term 7x, the coefficient is 7. A term is a single number or variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together. Terms are separated by plus or minus signs. For example, in the expression 3x squared plus 5x minus 2, there are three terms: 3x squared, 5x, and negative 2. Like terms are terms that have exactly the same variables raised to the same powers. Only the coefficients can be different. For example, 3x and 7x are like terms, as are 2y squared and negative 5y squared. However, 3x and 3y are not like terms because they have different variables. Similarly, 2x and 2x squared are not like terms because the variable x has different exponents. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of all variables in that term. For 5x squared y, the degree is 2 plus 1 equals 3. The degree of an algebraic expression is the highest degree of any term in the expression. A monomial is an expression with only one term, such as 5x or 3a squared b. A binomial is an expression with exactly two terms, such as 3x plus 7 or a squared minus b squared. A trinomial has three terms, such as x squared plus 5x plus 6. A polynomial is a general term for an expression with one or more terms. Now let us learn how to simplify algebraic expressions. Simplifying means to make the expression as simple as possible by combining like terms and performing any possible operations. The key rule is that you can only combine like terms. Step 1: Identify like terms in the expression. Step 2: Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms. Step 3: Keep the variable part unchanged. For example, simplify 5x plus 3y minus 2x plus 7y. First identify like terms: 5x and negative 2x are like terms; 3y and 7y are like terms. Combine 5x minus 2x to get 3x. Combine 3y plus 7y to get 10y. The simplified expression is 3x plus 10y. Another example: simplify 4a squared plus 3a minus 2a squared plus 5a minus 1. Like terms for a squared: 4a squared and negative 2a squared give 2a squared. Like terms for a: 3a and 5a give 8a. The constant is negative 1. The simplified expression is 2a squared plus 8a minus 1. When expressions contain brackets or parentheses, we must expand them using the distributive property. The distributive property states that a times the quantity b plus c equals a times b plus a times c. This allows us to remove brackets by multiplying each term inside the bracket by the term outside. For example, expand 3(2x plus 5). Multiply 3 by each term inside: 3 times 2x plus 3 times 5 equals 6x plus 15. Another example: expand negative 2(4y minus 3). Multiply negative 2 by each term: negative 2 times 4y plus negative 2 times negative 3 equals negative 8y plus 6. Be careful with signs! When you have two sets of brackets multiplied together, you must multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. This is often called the FOIL method for binomials, standing for First, Outer, Inner, Last. For example, expand (x plus 3)(x plus 5). Multiply First terms: x times x equals x squared. Multiply Outer terms: x times 5 equals 5x. Multiply Inner terms: 3 times x equals 3x. Multiply Last terms: 3 times 5 equals 15. Combine: x squared plus 5x plus 3x plus 15 equals x squared plus 8x plus 15. Another example: expand (2a minus 3)(a plus 4). First: 2a times a equals 2a squared. Outer: 2a times 4 equals 8a. Inner: negative 3 times a equals negative 3a. Last: negative 3 times 4 equals negative 12. Combine: 2a squared plus 8a minus 3a minus 12 equals 2a squared plus 5a minus 12. Factoring is the reverse process of expanding. To factor an expression means to write it as a product of simpler expressions. The most basic type of factoring is taking out a common factor. If all terms in an expression share a common factor, you can factor it out. For example, factor 6x plus 9. Both terms are divisible by 3: 6x equals 3 times 2x and 9 equals 3 times 3. Factor out 3: 3(2x plus 3). Check by expanding: 3 times 2x plus 3 times 3 equals 6x plus 9. Correct. Another example: factor 4a squared plus 8a. The common factor is 4a: 4a squared equals 4a times a and 8a equals 4a times 2. Factor out 4a: 4a(a plus 2). Some expressions can be factored using special patterns. The difference of two squares: a squared minus b squared equals (a plus b)(a minus b). For example, x squared minus 9 equals x squared minus 3 squared equals (x plus 3)(x minus 3). Perfect square trinomials follow the patterns: a squared plus 2ab plus b squared equals (a plus b) squared, and a squared minus 2ab plus b squared equals (a minus b) squared. For example, x squared plus 6x plus 9 equals x squared plus 2 times x times 3 plus 3 squared equals (x plus 3) squared. Adding and subtracting algebraic expressions involves combining like terms. When presented with multiple expressions to add or subtract, remove all brackets (being careful with signs) and then combine like terms. For example, add (3x squared plus 5x minus 2) and (2x squared minus 3x plus 7). Remove brackets: 3x squared plus 5x minus 2 plus 2x squared minus 3x plus 7. Combine like terms: (3x squared plus 2x squared) plus (5x minus 3x) plus (negative 2 plus 7) equals 5x squared plus 2x plus 5. For subtraction, remember that subtracting is the same as adding the negative. For example, subtract (4y squared minus 2y plus 3) from (7y squared plus 5y minus 1). This means (7y squared plus 5y minus 1) minus (4y squared minus 2y plus 3). Distribute the negative sign: 7y squared plus 5y minus 1 minus 4y squared plus 2y minus 3. Combine like terms: (7y squared minus 4y squared) plus (5y plus 2y) plus (negative 1 minus 3) equals 3y squared plus 7y minus 4. Multiplying algebraic expressions requires using the distributive property repeatedly. When multiplying a monomial by a polynomial, multiply the monomial by each term of the polynomial. For example, 2x times the quantity 3x squared minus 5x plus 4 equals 2x times 3x squared minus 2x times 5x plus 2x times 4 equals 6x cubed minus 10x squared plus 8x. When multiplying polynomials, multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial, then combine like terms. Division of algebraic expressions is more complex. When dividing a polynomial by a monomial, divide each term of the polynomial by the monomial separately. For example, (12x cubed minus 8x squared plus 4x) divided by 4x equals 12x cubed divided by 4x minus 8x squared divided by 4x plus 4x divided by 4x equals 3x squared minus 2x plus 1. Understanding order of operations is crucial when working with algebraic expressions. Remember PEMDAS or BODMAS: Parentheses or Brackets first, then Exponents or Orders, then Multiplication and Division from left to right, then Addition and Subtraction from left to right. Algebraic expressions can be evaluated by substituting specific values for the variables and calculating the result. For example, evaluate 3x squared minus 5x plus 2 when x equals 4. Substitute 4 for x: 3 times 4 squared minus 5 times 4 plus 2 equals 3 times 16 minus 20 plus 2 equals 48 minus 20 plus 2 equals 30.",
                        "intuition": "Think of algebraic expressions as recipes. Variables are like ingredients whose amounts can change, and the operations tell you what to do with those ingredients. Simplifying an expression is like simplifying a recipe by combining similar ingredients. Factoring is like breaking down a complex recipe into simpler components. When you understand the structure of expressions, you can manipulate them to solve problems just like you can adjust recipes to get desired results.",

Check by expanding: 4a times 3a squared minus 4a times 2a plus 4a times 1 equals 12a cubed minus 8a squared plus 4a. Correct."

Sets can contain any type of objects: numbers, letters, geometric figures, or even other sets. A set is well-defined if we can clearly determine whether a given object belongs to the set or not. For example, the set of even numbers is well-defined because we can determine if any number is even. However, the set of beautiful paintings is not well-defined because beauty is subjective. Sets are typically denoted by capital letters like A, B, C, and their elements are enclosed in curly braces. For example, A equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We use the symbol that looks like a curved E to denote membership. If x is an element of set A, we write x is in A. If x is not an element of A, we write x is not in A. There are several ways to represent sets. Roster or tabular form lists all elements explicitly within braces, such as A equals the set containing 2, 4, 6, 8. Set-builder form describes the property that elements must satisfy, such as B equals the set of all x such that x is an even natural number less than 10. Venn diagrams provide a visual representation of sets using circles or closed curves. The empty set or null set is a set containing no elements, denoted by the symbol that looks like a zero with a slash through it or by empty braces. For example, the set of real numbers x such that x squared equals negative 1 is empty. A finite set has a countable number of elements. An infinite set has uncountably many elements or continues indefinitely. For example, the set containing 1, 2, 3 is finite, while the set of all natural numbers is infinite. Two sets A and B are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Order and repetition do not matter. For example, the set containing 1, 2, 3 equals the set containing 3, 2, 1, and equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 2, 1. The cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains. For a set A, we denote cardinality as the absolute value of A or n of A. If A equals the set containing a, b, c, then the cardinality of A is 3. A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B, written A is a subset of B. For example, if A equals the set containing 1, 2 and B equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, then A is a subset of B. Every set is a subset of itself. The empty set is a subset of every set. A is a proper subset of B if A is a subset of B but A does not equal B, written A is a proper subset of B. The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A, denoted P of A or 2 to the power A. If A equals the set containing 1, 2, then P of A equals the set containing the empty set, the set containing 1, the set containing 2, the set containing 1 and 2. If a set has n elements, its power set has 2 to the power n elements. Now let us explore set operations. The union of two sets A and B, denoted A union B, is the set of elements that belong to A or B or both. Formally, A union B equals the set of all x such that x is in A or x is in B. For example, if A equals the set containing 1, 2, 3 and B equals the set containing 3, 4, 5, then A union B equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted A intersection B, is the set of elements that belong to both A and B. Formally, A intersection B equals the set of all x such that x is in A and x is in B. Using the previous example, A intersection B equals the set containing 3. Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set, meaning they have no common elements. The difference of two sets A and B, denoted A minus B or A backslash B, is the set of elements that belong to A but not to B. Formally, A minus B equals the set of all x such that x is in A and x is not in B. If A equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4 and B equals the set containing 3, 4, 5, then A minus B equals the set containing 1, 2. The complement of a set A, denoted A prime or A with a bar over it, is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. The universal set U is the set containing all objects under consideration. A complement equals U minus A. If U equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and A equals the set containing 1, 2, then A complement equals the set containing 3, 4, 5. The symmetric difference of A and B, denoted A triangle B, is the set of elements in either A or B but not in both. It equals the quantity A union B minus the quantity A intersection B, or equivalently, the quantity A minus B union the quantity B minus A. Set operations follow several important laws. The commutative law states A union B equals B union A and A intersection B equals B intersection A. The associative law states the quantity A union B union C equals A union the quantity B union C, and similarly for intersection. The distributive law states A intersection the quantity B union C equals the quantity A intersection B union the quantity A intersection C. Also, A union the quantity B intersection C equals the quantity A union B intersection the quantity A union C. De Morgan's laws are crucial: the complement of A union B equals A complement intersection B complement, and the complement of A intersection B equals A complement union B complement. These laws allow us to simplify complex set expressions. An ordered pair consists of two elements in a specific order, written as parentheses a comma b. Two ordered pairs parentheses a comma b and parentheses c comma d are equal if and only if a equals c and b equals d. Unlike sets, order matters in ordered pairs. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A cross B, is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second is from B. Formally, A cross B equals the set of all ordered pairs parentheses a comma b such that a is in A and b is in B. For example, if A equals the set containing 1, 2 and B equals the set containing x, y, then A cross B equals the set containing the ordered pairs 1 comma x, 1 comma y, 2 comma x, 2 comma y. If A has m elements and B has n elements, then A cross B has m times n elements. A relation from set A to set B is a subset of A cross B. In other words, a relation is a set of ordered pairs where the first element comes from A and the second from B. If A equals B, we say R is a relation on A. For example, if A equals the set containing 1, 2, 3, we can define a relation R where R equals the set of ordered pairs parentheses x comma y such that x is less than y. Then R contains ordered pairs 1 comma 2, 1 comma 3, 2 comma 3. The domain of a relation R is the set of all first elements in the ordered pairs. The range is the set of all second elements. Relations can have various properties. A relation R on set A is reflexive if every element is related to itself: for all a in A, the ordered pair a comma a is in R. For example, the relation equals on real numbers is reflexive because x equals x for all x. R is symmetric if whenever a is related to b, then b is related to a: if the ordered pair a comma b is in R, then the ordered pair b comma a is in R. The relation equals is symmetric because if x equals y, then y equals x. R is transitive if whenever a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c: if ordered pairs a comma b and b comma c are in R, then the ordered pair a comma c is in R. The relation less than is transitive because if x is less than y and y is less than z, then x is less than z. R is antisymmetric if whenever both ordered pairs a comma b and b comma a are in R, then a equals b. The relation less than or equal to is antisymmetric. An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Equality is the most common example. Equivalence relations partition a set into equivalence classes where elements within each class are equivalent to each other.",

                        "theory": "A function is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. A function describes a special relationship between two sets where each input is associated with exactly one output. Think of a function as a machine: you put something in, the machine processes it according to a rule, and you get exactly one thing out. Formally, a function f from set A to set B is a rule that assigns to each element x in A exactly one element y in B. We write this as f colon A maps to B. The element y is called the image of x under f, and we write y equals f of x, read as f of x. The set A is called the domain of the function, which contains all possible input values. The set B is called the codomain, while the range is the set of all actual output values. The range is a subset of the codomain. For example, consider the function f of x equals x squared where the domain is all real numbers. For any input x, the output is x squared. If x equals 3, then f of 3 equals 9. If x equals negative 2, then f of negative 2 equals 4. Notice that different inputs can give the same output with functions like x squared, but each input gives exactly one output. This is the key property: one input maps to one output. Function notation f of x is extremely useful. It clearly shows that f is the name of the function and x is the input variable. To evaluate a function at a specific value, substitute that value for x. For example, if f of x equals 3x minus 5, then f of 2 equals 3 times 2 minus 5 equals 6 minus 5 equals 1. Similarly, f of 0 equals 3 times 0 minus 5 equals negative 5. We can also evaluate functions at algebraic expressions. For f of x equals x squared plus 2x and finding f of a plus 1, we substitute a plus 1 for every x: f of a plus 1 equals the quantity a plus 1 squared plus 2 times the quantity a plus 1 equals a squared plus 2a plus 1 plus 2a plus 2 equals a squared plus 4a plus 3. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined. For polynomial functions like f of x equals 2x cubed minus 5x plus 1, the domain is all real numbers because you can square, cube, or perform any polynomial operation on any real number. However, some functions have restrictions. For rational functions with denominators, we must exclude values that make the denominator zero. For example, f of x equals 1 divided by the quantity x  minus 3 has domain all real numbers except x equals 3, because at x equals 3 the denominator becomes zero and division by zero is undefined. For square root functions, we need the expression under the radical to be non-negative. The function f of x equals the square root of x has domain x greater than or equal to 0, because square roots of negative numbers are not real. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. Finding the range requires analyzing what values the function can produce. For f of x equals x squared with domain all real numbers, what outputs are possible? Since any real number squared is non-negative, and we can get arbitrarily large positive values, the range is all real numbers y such that y greater than or equal to 0. For f of x equals x squared plus 1, since x squared is at least 0, the minimum value is 1, so the range is y greater than or equal to 1. A vertical line test helps determine if a curve represents a function. If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, it is not a function, because one input would correspond to multiple outputs. For example, the circle x squared plus y squared equals 4 is not a function because a vertical line at x equals 0 intersects at y equals 2 and y equals negative 2. Functions can be classified by type. Linear functions have the form f of x equals mx plus b, where m and b are constants. Their graphs are straight lines. Quadratic functions have the form f of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c where a is not zero. Their graphs are parabolas. Polynomial functions have the form f of x equals a sub n times x to the power n plus a sub n minus 1 times x to the power n minus 1 plus dot dot dot plus a sub 1 times x plus a sub 0. Rational functions are ratios of polynomials, f of x equals p of x divided by q of x where p and q are polynomials. Absolute value functions have the form f of x equals the absolute value of x or variations. Piecewise functions are defined by different formulas for different parts of the domain. Function operations allow us to create new functions from existing ones. If f and g are functions, we can define sum f plus g, difference f minus g, product f times g, and quotient f divided by g. For sum, the quantity f plus g of x equals f of x plus g of x. The domain is the intersection of the domains of f and g. For example, if f of x equals 2x and g of x equals x plus 3, then the quantity f plus g of x equals 2x plus x plus 3 equals 3x plus 3. Composition of functions is a powerful operation. The composition f composed with g, written as f circle g or f of g of x, means apply g first, then apply f to the result. Formally, f of g of x equals f applied to the quantity g of x. The domain of f composed with g consists of all x in the domain of g such that g of x is in the domain of f. For example, if f of x equals x squared and g of x equals x plus 1, then f of g of x equals f of the quantity x plus 1 equals the quantity x plus 1 squared equals x squared plus 2x plus 1. Note that g of f of x equals g of x squared equals x squared plus 1, which is different. Composition is generally not commutative. Even and odd functions have special symmetry properties. A function f is even if f of negative x equals f of x for all x in the domain. Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. Examples include f of x equals x squared and f of x equals cosine x. A function f is odd if f of negative x equals negative f of x for all x in the domain. Odd functions have rotational symmetry about the origin. Examples include f of x equals x cubed and f of x equals sine x. One-to-one functions are functions where different inputs always give different outputs. Formally, f is one-to-one if whenever f of a equals f of b, then a equals b. Equivalently, if a does not equal b, then f of a does not equal f of b. The horizontal line test determines if a function is one-to-one: if any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is not one-to-one. For example, f of x equals x cubed is one-to-one, but f of x equals x squared is not because f of 2 equals f of negative 2 equals 4. Inverse functions reverse the action of a function. If f is a one-to-one function with domain A and range B, the inverse function f inverse has domain B and range A, and it satisfies f inverse of f of x equals x for all x in A, and f of f inverse of y equals y for all y in B. To find an inverse function, replace f of x with y, swap x and y, and solve for y. For example, find the inverse of f of x equals 2x minus 3. Write y equals 2x minus 3, swap to get x equals 2y minus 3, solve for y: x plus 3 equals 2y, so y equals the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2. Thus f inverse of x equals the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2. Verify: f of f inverse of x equals f of the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2 equals 2 times the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2 minus 3 equals x plus 3 minus 3 equals x. Increasing and decreasing functions describe how function values change. A function f is increasing on an interval if whenever a is less than b, then f of a is less than f of b. It is decreasing on an interval if whenever a is less than b, then f of a is greater than f of b. For example, f of x equals x squared is decreasing on the interval negative infinity to 0 and increasing on 0 to positive infinity.",

You cannot get two different snacks from the same code, which is why a function must give exactly one output per input.

The domain is all available codes, and the range is all possible snacks the machine can dispense.",

                        "theory": "Coordinate geometry, also called analytic geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. This powerful method bridges algebra and geometry, allowing us to represent geometric figures using algebraic equations and solve geometric problems using algebraic techniques. The foundation of coordinate geometry is the Cartesian coordinate system, named after the French mathematician Rene Descartes. The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular number lines called axes. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis, and the vertical axis is called the y-axis. These axes intersect at a point called the origin, denoted O, which has coordinates zero comma zero. The axes divide the plane into four regions called quadrants. Quadrant I is the upper right region where both x and y coordinates are positive. Quadrant II is the upper left where x is negative and y is positive. Quadrant III is the lower left where both are negative. Quadrant IV is the lower right where x is positive and y is negative. Any point in the plane can be represented by an ordered pair of numbers parentheses x comma y called coordinates. The first number x is the x-coordinate or abscissa, indicating the horizontal distance from the origin. The second number y is the y-coordinate or ordinate, indicating the vertical distance from the origin. To plot a point with coordinates parentheses a comma b, start at the origin, move a units horizontally (right if positive, left if negative), then move b units vertically (up if positive, down if negative). For example, the point parentheses 3 comma 2 is located 3 units right and 2 units up from the origin. The point parentheses negative 2 comma 4 is 2 units left and 4 units up. The distance formula calculates the distance between two points. If we have points P1 with coordinates parentheses x1 comma y1 and P2 with coordinates parentheses x2 comma y2, the distance d between them is found using the Pythagorean theorem. Imagine a right triangle where the distance between the points is the hypotenuse. The horizontal leg has length the absolute value of x2 minus x1, and the vertical leg has length the absolute value of y2 minus y1. By the Pythagorean theorem, d squared equals the quantity x2 minus x1 squared plus the quantity y2 minus y1 squared. Taking the square root of both sides gives d equals the square root of the quantity x2 minus x1 squared plus the quantity y2 minus y1 squared. For example, find the distance between parentheses 1 comma 2 and parentheses 4 comma 6. Using the formula: d equals the square root of the quantity 4 minus 1 squared plus the quantity 6 minus 2 squared equals the square root of 3 squared plus 4 squared equals the square root of 9 plus 16 equals the square root of 25 equals 5. The midpoint formula finds the point exactly halfway between two given points. If P1 has coordinates parentheses x1 comma y1 and P2 has coordinates parentheses x2 comma y2, the midpoint M has coordinates parentheses the quantity x1 plus x2 divided by 2 comma the quantity y1 plus y2 divided by 2. In other words, the midpoint coordinates are the averages of the corresponding coordinates. For example, the midpoint between parentheses 2 comma 3 and parentheses 8 comma 7 is parentheses the quantity 2 plus 8 divided by 2 comma the quantity 3 plus 7 divided by 2 equals parentheses 5 comma 5. The slope of a line measures its steepness and direction. slope is defined as rise over run, or the change in y divided by the change in x. For a line passing through points parentheses x1 comma y1 and parentheses x2 comma y2 where x1 does not equal x2, the slope m equals y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1. Positive slope means the line rises from left to right. Negative slope means the line falls from left to right. Zero slope indicates a horizontal line. Undefined slope corresponds to a vertical line where x1 equals x2. For example, find the slope of the line through parentheses 1 comma 2 and parentheses 5 comma 10. The slope m equals 10 minus 2 divided by 5 minus 1 equals 8 divided by 4 equals 2. Parallel lines have equal slopes. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. If line 1 has slope m1 and line 2 has slope m2, and the lines are perpendicular, then m1 times m2 equals negative 1, or m2 equals negative 1 divided by m1. Linear equations can be written in several forms. The slope-intercept form is y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept (the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis). This form is most convenient for graphing. The point-slope form is y minus y1 equals m times the quantity x minus x1, where m is the slope and parentheses x1 comma y1 is a point on the line. This form is useful when you know a point and the slope. The standard form is Ax plus By equals C, where A, B, and C are constants with A and B not both zero. This form is useful for some algebraic manipulations. The general form is Ax plus By plus C equals 0. To convert between forms, use algebraic manipulation. For example, convert y minus 3 equals 2 times the quantity x minus 1 to slope-intercept form: distribute to get y minus 3 equals 2x minus 2, then add 3 to both sides to get y equals 2x plus 1. A circle is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The standard equation of a circle with center parentheses h comma k and radius r is the quantity x minus h squared plus the quantity y minus k squared equals r squared. This comes directly from the distance formula. If the center is at the origin parentheses 0 comma 0, the equation simplifies to x squared plus y squared equals r squared. For example, the equation the quantity x minus 2 squared plus the quantity y plus 3 squared equals 25 represents a circle with center parentheses 2 comma negative 3 and radius 5. To find the equation given the center and radius, substitute into the standard form. Given center parentheses 1 comma 4 and radius 3, the equation is the quantity x minus 1 squared plus the quantity y minus 4 squared equals 9.",

                        "theory": "Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and the likelihood of events occurring. In everyday life, we constantly make decisions based on probability, whether consciously or not. When we check the weather forecast, buy insurance, or play games, we are dealing with probability. The mathematical study of probability provides a rigorous framework for quantifying uncertainty. An experiment or trial is any procedure that can be repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes. For example, flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card from a deck are all experiments. The sample space, denoted S or omega, is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a single coin flip, S equals the set containing H comma T where H represents heads and T represents tails. For rolling a standard six-sided die, S equals the set containing 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6. An event is any subset of the sample space. An event can consist of a single outcome or multiple outcomes. For example, when rolling a die, the event getting an even number is the set containing 2 comma 4 comma 6. Events are typically denoted by capital letters like A, B, or E. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood of the event occurring. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible and will never occur. A probability of 1 means the event is certain and will always occur. Probabilities between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of likelihood. We write P of A for the probability of event A. The classical or theoretical definition of probability applies when all outcomes are equally likely. If an experiment has n equally likely outcomes and an event A consists of m of those outcomes, then P of A equals m divided by n. In other words, P of A equals the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when rolling a fair die, the probability of getting a 3 is P of 3 equals 1 divided by 6, because there is 1 favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of 6 total outcomes. The probability of getting an even number is P of even equals 3 divided by 6 equals 1 half, because there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 total. Properties of probability provide important rules. First, the probability of any event is between 0 and 1: 0 less than or equal to P of A less than or equal to 1. Second, the probability of the certain event (the entire sample space) is 1: P of S equals 1. Third, the probability of the impossible event (the empty set) is 0: P of empty set equals 0. The complement of an event A, denoted A prime or A with a bar over it or A complement, consists of all outcomes NOT in A. The complement rule states that P of A complement equals 1 minus P of A. This is useful because sometimes it is easier to calculate the probability that an event does not occur. For example, when rolling a die, the probability of NOT getting a 6 is P of not 6 equals 1 minus P of 6 equals 1 minus 1 sixth equals 5 sixths. The addition rule deals with the probability of the union of events. For any two events A and B, the probability that A or B or both occur is P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B minus P of A intersection B. We subtract P of A intersection B because when we add P of A and P of B, we count the outcomes in both A and B twice. If events A and B are mutually exclusive or disjoint, meaning they cannot both occur simultaneously (their intersection is empty), then P of A intersection B equals 0, and the addition rule simplifies to P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B. For example, when rolling a die, let A be the event of getting a 2 and B be the event of getting a 5. These are mutually exclusive. P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B equals 1 sixth plus 1 sixth equals 2 sixths equals 1 third. Conditional probability measures the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The conditional probability of A given B, written P of A given B or P of A vertical bar B, is the probability that A occurs given that we know B has occurred. The formula is P of A given B equals P of A intersection B divided by P of B, provided P of B is not zero. For example, suppose we draw a card from a standard 52-card deck. Let A be the event that the card is an ace and B be the event that the card is a spade. P of A equals 4 divided by 52 equals 1 thirteenth because there are 4 aces. P of B equals 13 divided by 52 equals 1 fourth because there are 13 spades. A intersection B is the event of getting the ace of spades, so P of A intersection B equals 1 divided by 52. The conditional probability P of A given B equals the quantity 1 divided by 52 divided by the quantity 13 divided by 52 equals 1 divided by 13. This makes sense: if we know the card is a spade, there is 1 ace among the 13 spades. Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, A and B are independent if P of A given B equals P of A, or equivalently, P of B given A equals P of B. For independent events, we have the multiplication rule: P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B. For example, flipping a coin twice, let A be getting heads on the first flip and B be getting heads on the second flip. These are independent. P of A equals 1 half and P of B equals 1 half, so P of both heads equals P of A times P of B equals 1 half times 1 half equals 1 fourth. If events are not independent, they are dependent, and we use the general multiplication rule: P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B given A equals P of B times P of A given B.",
                        "intuition": "Think of probability as a measure of how often something would happen if you repeated an experiment many times. If you flip a fair coin thousands of times, you expect about half to be heads, which is why P of heads equals one half. Conditional probability is like updating your expectations based on new information. If you know it is raining, the probability someone is carrying an umbrella increases, even though on a random day it might be low. Independent events are like separate experiments that do not influence each other, like flipping two different coins.",

                        "theory": "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. In our data-driven world, statistical literacy is essential for making informed decisions. Whether reading news articles, conducting research, or analyzing business performance, we encounter statistics daily. The goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data to understand patterns, make predictions, and support decision-making. Data are individual pieces of information collected from observations or measurements. Data can be qualitative or categorical, describing attributes like color or gender, or quantitative or numerical, representing measurable quantities like height or temperature. Quantitative data can be discrete, taking only specific values like number of students, or continuous, taking any value within a range like weight or time. A population is the complete set of all individuals or items being studied. A sample is a subset of the population selected for analysis. We use sample statistics to make inferences about population parameters. For example, if we want to know the average height of all adults in a country, measuring everyone is impractical, so we measure a representative sample and use that to estimate the population average. Measures of central tendency describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The mean, often called the average, is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. For a dataset with n values x1, x2, up to xn, the mean denoted x bar equals the quantity x1 plus x2 plus dot dot dot plus xn all divided by n. For example, for the dataset 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9, the mean equals the quantity 4 plus 8 plus 6 plus 5 plus 3 plus 9 divided by 6 equals 35 divided by 6 approximately equals 5.83. The mean is sensitive to extreme values called outliers. The median is the middle value when data are arranged in order. For an odd number of values, it is the value in the center position. For an even number of values, it is the average of the two middle values. For the dataset 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 arranged in order, the median is the average of 5 and 6, which is 5.5. The median is resistant to outliers and better represents typical value for skewed data. The mode is the value that appears most frequently. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), many modes (multimodal), or no mode if all values occur equally. For the dataset 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 4, 7, the mode is 4 because it appears three times. Measures of dispersion or spread describe how scattered or concentrated the data are. The range is the simplest measure, calculated as the maximum value minus the minimum value. For the dataset 3, 7, 2, 9, 5, the range equals 9 minus 2 equals 7. The range only uses two values and ignores everything in between. Variance and standard deviation provide more comprehensive measures. The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. For a population with N values, the population variance denoted sigma squared equals the sum of the quantity xi minus mu squared divided by N, where mu is the population mean. For a sample with n values, the sample variance denoted s squared equals the sum of the quantity xi minus x bar squared divided by n minus 1, where x bar is the sample mean. We divide by n minus 1 for the sample to get an unbiased estimate. Standard deviation is the square root of variance, bringing the measure back to the original units. Population standard deviation is sigma, and sample standard deviation is s. For example, consider the dataset 4, 8, 6. The mean is 4 plus 8 plus 6 divided by 3 equals 6. Deviations from mean: 4 minus 6 equals negative 2, 8 minus 6 equals 2, 6 minus 6 equals 0. Squared deviations: 4, 4, 0. Variance equals 4 plus 4 plus 0 divided by 3 minus 1 equals 8 divided by 2 equals 4. Standard deviation equals the square root of 4 equals 2. Data can be organized using frequency tables showing how many times each value occurs. Grouped frequency tables group data into intervals called classes. Graphs and charts provide visual representations. Bar charts display categorical data with rectangular bars. Histograms show quantitative data distributions with adjacent bars. Pie charts show proportions of a whole. Line graphs display data trends over time. Box plots show five-number summary: minimum, first quartile Q1, median Q2, third quartile Q3, and maximum. Quartiles divide ordered data into four equal parts. Q1 is the median of the lower half, Q2 is the overall median, and Q3 is the median of the upper half. The interquartile range IQR equals Q3 minus Q1, measuring the spread of the middle 50 percent of data. Outliers can be identified as values below Q1 minus 1.5 times IQR or above Q3 plus 1.5 times IQR.",
                        "intuition": "Think of statistics as tools for summarizing information in a large dataset. Instead of listing thousands of numbers, we use a few key values like mean and standard deviation to capture the essence. The mean tells you the typical value, while standard deviation tells you how much values typically differ from that average. Visualizing data with graphs is like creating a picture worth a thousand numbers, helping us see patterns and trends instantly.",

                        "theory": "A polynomial is an algebraic expression consisting of variables and coefficients combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication, with non-negative integer exponents. Polynomials are fundamental in algebra and appear throughout mathematics and applications. The general form of a polynomial in one variable x is a sub n times x to the power n plus a sub n minus 1 times x to the power n minus 1 plus dot dot dot plus a sub 1 times x plus a sub 0, where the a values are coefficients and n is a non-negative integer. For example, 3x squared plus 5x minus 2, x cubed minus 4x plus 7, and 5x to the fourth minus 2x squared plus x minus 9 are all polynomials. Each part separated by plus or minus is called a term. The coefficient is the numerical factor in each term. The degree of a term is the exponent of the variable. The degree of the polynomial is the highest degree of any term. For 3x squared plus 5x minus 2, the terms are 3x squared, 5x, and negative 2. The degrees are 2, 1, and 0. The polynomial degree is 2. Polynomials are classified by degree. A polynomial of degree 0 is a constant, like 5. Degree 1 is linear, like 2x plus 3. Degree 2 is quadratic, like x squared minus 4x plus 1. Degree 3 is cubic, like x cubed plus 2x squared minus x plus 5. Degree 4 is quartic. Degree 5 is quintic. Polynomials are also classified by number of terms. A monomial has one term, like 5x cubed. A binomial has two terms, like 3x plus 7. A trinomial has three terms, like x squared plus 5x plus 6. The leading term is the term with the highest degree, and its coefficient is the leading coefficient. For 4x cubed minus 2x squared plus x minus 3, the leading term is 4x cubed and the leading coefficient is 4. Adding and subtracting polynomials involves combining like terms. Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power. To add polynomials, remove parentheses and combine like terms. For example, add 3x squared plus 5x minus 2 and x squared minus 3x plus 7. Combine: 3x squared plus x squared equals 4x squared. 5x minus 3x equals 2x. Negative 2 plus 7 equals 5. Result: 4x squared plus 2x plus 5. For subtraction, distribute the negative sign and combine. Subtract x squared minus 3x plus 4 from 5x squared plus 2x minus 1. This is 5x squared plus 2x minus 1 minus the quantity x squared minus 3x plus 4. Distribute: 5x squared plus 2x minus 1 minus x squared plus 3x minus 4. Combine: 4x squared plus 5x minus 5. Multiplying polynomials requires multiplying each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second. For monomials, multiply coefficients and add exponents of like variables. For example, 3x squared times 5x cubed equals 15x to the fifth. For a monomial times a polynomial, use the distributive property. For 2x times the quantity 3x squared minus 4x plus 5, multiply: 2x times 3x squared equals 6x cubed. 2x times negative 4x equals negative 8x squared. 2x times 5 equals 10x. Result: 6x cubed minus 8x squared plus 10x. For binomials, use FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last. For x plus 3 times x plus 5, First: x times x equals x squared. Outer: x times 5 equals 5x. Inner: 3 times x equals 3x. Last: 3 times 5 equals 15. Combine: x squared plus 8x plus 15. Special products save time. The square of a binomial: the quantity a plus b squared equals a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. The quantity a minus b squared equals a squared minus 2ab plus b squared. Difference of squares: a plus b times a minus b equals a squared minus b squared. Factoring is writing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. It is the reverse of multiplication. The first step is always to factor out the greatest common factor GCF. For 6x cubed minus 9x squared plus 3x, the GCF is 3x. Factor: 3x times the quantity 2x squared minus 3x plus 1. Factoring trinomials of form x squared plus bx plus c: find two numbers whose product is c and whose sum is b. For x squared plus 7x plus 12, find numbers with product 12 and sum 7. These are 3 and 4. Factor: x plus 3 times x plus 4. For trinomials ax squared plus bx plus c where a is not 1, use methods like grouping or trial and error. Special factoring patterns: difference of squares: a squared minus b squared equals the quantity a plus b times the quantity a minus b. Sum or difference of cubes: a cubed plus b cubed equals the quantity a plus b times the quantity a squared minus ab plus b squared. A cubed minus b cubed equals the quantity a minus b times the quantity a squared plus ab plus b squared. Perfect square trinomials: a squared plus 2ab plus b squared equals the quantity a plus b squared. A squared minus 2ab plus b squared equals the quantity a minus b squared. The zero product property states that if a times b equals 0, then a equals 0 or b equals 0. This is used to solve polynomial equations by factoring. To solve ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0, factor the left side, set each factor equal to zero, and solve. For example, solve x squared plus 5x plus 6 equals 0. Factor: the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x plus 3 equals 0. Set factors to zero: x plus 2 equals 0 gives x equals negative 2. X plus 3 equals 0 gives x equals negative 3. Solutions are x equals negative 2 and x equals negative 3. The roots or zeros of a polynomial are the values of x that make the polynomial equal zero. Graphically, they are the x-intercepts.

The factor theorem states that x minus a is a factor of polynomial p of x if and only if p of a equals 0. These theorems connect factoring with function evaluation.",

                        "theory": "An inequality is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using inequality symbols. Unlike equations that state two expressions are equal, inequalities show that one expression is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another. The inequality symbols are: less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. For example, x greater than 5 means x is greater than 5. Y less than or equal to 10 means y is less than or equal to 10. Inequalities have many solutions, unlike equations that typically have specific solutions. For x greater than 3, any number larger than 3 is a solution: 4, 5, 3.1, 100, and so on. We can represent solutions on a number line. For x greater than 3, draw a number line, mark 3 with an open circle (since 3 is not included), and shade everything to the right. An open circle means the endpoint is not included. A closed circle means it is included. For x greater than or equal to 3, use a closed circle at 3. Properties of inequalities help solve them. The addition property states that adding or subtracting the same number to both sides preserves the inequality. If a less than b, then a plus c less than b plus c. For example, if x minus 4 less than 7, add 4 to both sides to get x less than 11. The multiplication property states that multiplying or dividing both sides by a positive number preserves the inequality. If a less than b and c greater than 0, then a times c less than b times c. However, multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality. If a less than b and c less than 0, then a times c greater than b times c. This is crucial: when you multiply or divide by a negative, flip the inequality sign. For example, solve negative 2x greater than 6. Divide both sides by negative 2, reversing the inequality: x less than negative 3. To solve linear inequalities, use similar steps as solving equations, but remember to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers. Example: solve 3x minus 5 less than or equal to 10. Add 5 to both sides: 3x less than or equal to 15. Divide by 3: x less than or equal to 5. Solution is all x less than or equal to 5, written in interval notation as negative infinity to 5 closed bracket. Compound inequalities involve two separate inequalities combined with and or or. An and compound inequality like a less than x and x less than b is often written as a less than x less than b, meaning x is between a and b. The solution is the intersection of the individual solutions. For example, negative 2 less than x less than or equal to 5 means x is greater than negative 2 and x is less than or equal to 5. On a number line, use an open circle at negative 2 and a closed circle at 5, shading between them. An or compound inequality means the solution satisfies at least one inequality. The solution is the union of individual solutions. For x less than 1 or x greater than or equal to 4, shade left of 1 (open circle) and right of 4 (closed circle). Absolute value inequalities involve the absolute value function. Recall the absolute value of x, written vertical bar x vertical bar, represents the distance of x from zero. The absolute value of x equals x if x greater than or equal to 0, and equals negative x if x less than 0. For absolute value less than inequalities: vertical bar x vertical bar less than a where a greater than 0 is equivalent to negative a less than x less than a. For example, vertical bar x vertical bar less than 3 means negative 3 less than x less than 3. For absolute value greater than inequalities: vertical bar x vertical bar greater than a where a greater than 0 is equivalent to x less than negative a or x greater than a. For example, vertical bar x vertical bar greater than 2 means x less than negative 2 or x greater than 2. More complex absolute value inequalities require isolating the absolute value first. Solve vertical bar 2x minus 1 vertical bar less than or equal to 5. This means negative 5 less than or equal to 2x minus 1 less than or equal to 5. Add 1 to all parts: negative 4 less than or equal to 2x less than or equal to 6. Divide by 2: negative 2 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 3. Graphing linear inequalities in two variables: an inequality like y greater than 2x plus 1 has infinitely many solutions that are ordered pairs. To graph, first graph the boundary line y equals 2x plus 1. Use a dashed line if the inequality is strict (greater than or less than) because points on the line are not solutions. Use a solid line for greater than or equal to or less than or equal to because points on the line are included. Then determine which side to shade by testing a point. The origin (0, 0) is convenient if not on the line. For y greater than 2x plus 1, test (0, 0): is 0 greater than 2 times 0 plus 1, is 0 greater than 1, which is false. So shade the side not containing (0, 0). Systems of inequalities involve finding solutions satisfying multiple inequalities simultaneously. Graph each inequality and find the overlapping shaded region. Interval notation is a compact way to write solution sets. Square brackets indicate inclusion, parentheses indicate exclusion. For x greater than or equal to 2, write 2 with square bracket to positive infinity with parenthesis. For negative 1 less than x less than 3, write parenthesis negative 1 comma 3 parenthesis.",
                        "intuition": "Think of inequalities as describing ranges rather than exact values. Instead of saying you must be exactly 18 years old, an inequality might say you must be at least 18 or at most 65. On a number line, equations are single points, but inequalities are entire regions. Flipping the inequality when multiplying by a negative is like reversing perspective: if you have less money than me and we both get into debt (multiply by negative), now you actually have more debt (reverse the inequality).",

                        "theory": "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental tools in linear algebra with applications in computer graphics, engineering, economics, and data science. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m by n matrix. We denote matrices with capital letters and enclose elements in brackets. The general m by n matrix A has the form: first row contains elements a11, a12, up to a1n, second row contains a21, a22, up to a2n, continuing to the mth row with am1, am2, up to amn. The element in row i and column j is denoted as aij. For example, the 2 by 3 matrix A equals the matrix with first row 1, 2, 3 and second row 4, 5, 6. Here a11 equals 1, a12 equals 2, a23 equals 6. A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns. A 3 by 3 matrix is square. The main diagonal of a square matrix consists of elements where row equals column: a11, a22, a33, et cetera. An identity matrix I is a square matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere. The 3 by 3 identity matrix has first row 1 0 0, second row 0 1 0, third row 0 0 1. A zero matrix has all elements equal to zero. Matrix addition and subtraction require matrices of the same dimensions. To add or subtract matrices, add or subtract corresponding elements. If A and B are both m by n matrices, then A plus B equals the matrix where element ij is aij plus bij. For example, if A has first row 1 2 and second row 3 4, and B has first row 5 6 and second row 7 8, then A plus B has first row 6 8 and second row 10 12. Scalar multiplication multiplies every element of a matrix by a scalar constant. If c is a scalar and A is a matrix, then cA equals the matrix where element ij is c times aij. For example, 3 times the matrix with first row 1 2 and second row 3 4 equals the matrix with first row 3 6 and second row 9 12. Matrix multiplication is more complex. To multiply matrix A times matrix B, the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B. If A is m by n and B is n by p, then AB is m by p. The element in row i and column j of AB equals the sum of aik times bkj for k from 1 to n. This is the dot product of row i of A with column j of B. Matrixmultiplication is not commutative: AB generally does not equal BA. For example, multiply 2 by 2 matrix A with first row 1 2 second row 3 4 by 2 by 2 matrix B with first row 5 6 second row 7 8. Element 11 of AB: 1 times 5 plus 2 times 7 equals 19. Element 12: 1 times 6 plus 2 times 8 equals 22. Element 21: 3 times 5 plus 4 times 7 equals 43. Element 22: 3 times 6 plus 4 times 8 equals 50. So AB has first row 19 22 second row 43 50. The determinant is a scalar value computed from a square matrix. For a 2 by 2 matrix with first row a b second row c d, the determinant equals ad minus bc. For larger matrices, determinants are computed using cofactor expansion. Determinants have important properties: the determinant of the identity matrix equals 1, swapping two rows multiplies the determinant by negative 1, the determinant of a matrix with a zero row is zero. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is nonzero. The inverse of matrix A, denoted A inverse, satisfies A times A inverse equals A inverse times A equals I. For a 2 by 2 matrix with first row a b second row c d and determinant D equals ad minus bc not zero, the inverse equals 1 over D times the matrix with first row d negative b second row negative c a. Matrix inverses are used to solve systems of linear equations. A system like 2x plus 3y equals 8, 4x minus y equals 2 can be written as matrix equation AX equals B where A is coefficient matrix, X is variable column vector, B is constant column vector. If A is invertible, then X equals A inverse times B.",
                        "intuition": "Think of matrices as organized tables of data. When you add matrices, you are combining tables element by element. Matrix multiplication is like applying a transformation: each row of the first matrix interacts with each column of the second to produce results. The determinant tells you if a matrix transformation is reversible, like checking if you can undo a geometric transformation. Matrices are the language computers use to perform complex calculations efficiently.",

                        "theory": "The concept of limit is the foundation of calculus. A limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value. Limits allow us to rigorously define instantaneous rates of change (derivatives) and accumulated quantities (integrals). The notation limit as x approaches a of f of x equals L means as x gets arbitrarily close to a (but not necessarily equal to a), the function values f of x get arbitrarily close to L. For example, consider f of x equals x squared. As x approaches 3, f of x approaches 9. We write limit as x approaches 3 of x squared equals 9. Notice we can verify this by substitution since the function is well-behaved at x equals 3. However, limits are most powerful when direct substitution fails. Consider limit as x approaches 2 of the quantity x squared minus 4 divided by the quantity x minus 2. Direct substitution gives 0 over 0, which is undefined. But we can factor: x squared minus 4 equals the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2. So the expression becomes the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2 divided by the quantity x minus 2. For x not equal to 2, this simplifies to x plus 2. Thus limit as x approaches 2 of the expression equals limit as x approaches 2 of x plus 2 equals 4. This demonstrates that limits concern behavior near a point, not at the point. Limit laws allow us to compute limits of combinations of functions. If limit as x approaches a of f of x equals L and limit as x approaches a of g of x equals M, then: sum rule: limit of f plus g equals L plus M, difference rule: limit of f minus g equals L minus M, product rule: limit of f times g equals L times M, quotient rule: limit of f over g equals L over M provided M not zero, power rule: limit of f to the power n equals L to the power n, constant multiple rule: limit of c times f equals c times L for constant c. For example, find limit as x approaches 4 of 3x squared minus 2x plus 1. Using limit laws: limit of 3x squared equals 3 times limit of x squared equals 3 times 16 equals 48. Limit of 2x equals 2 times 4 equals 8. Limit of constant 1 equals 1. Total: 48 minus 8 plus 1 equals 41. One-sided limits consider approach from one direction. Right-hand limit, limit as x approaches a from the right of f of x, means x approaches a through values greater than a. Left-hand limit, limit as x approaches a from the left, means x approaches a through values less than a. For a limit to exist, both one-sided limits must exist and be equal. Indeterminate forms occur when direct substitution yields expressions like 0 over 0, infinity over infinity, 0 times infinity, infinity minus infinity, 1 to the infinity, 0 to the 0, or infinity to the 0. These require special techniques. For 0 over 0, try factoring and canceling, rationalizing numerators or denominators, or using LHopitals rule (covered in advanced calculus). Limits at infinity describe function behavior as x increases or decreases without bound. Limit as x approaches infinity of 1 over x equals 0 because as x gets larger, 1 over x gets closer to 0. For rational functions, divide numerator and denominator by highest power of x. Limit as x approaches infinity of the quantity 3x squared plus 2x divided by the quantity 5x squared minus x: divide by x squared to get limit of the quantity 3 plus 2 over x all divided by the quantity 5 minus 1 over x. As x approaches infinity, terms with x in denominator approach 0, giving 3 over 5. A function f is continuous at a point a if three conditions hold: f of a is defined, limit as x approaches a of f of x exists, and limit as x approaches a of f of x equals f of a. Intuitively, a function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting your pencil. Most elementary functions including polynomials, rational functions (where defined), exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains. Discontinuities occur when continuity fails. A removable discontinuity occurs when the limit exists but does not equal the function value, often appearing as a hole in the graph. A jump discontinuity occurs when left and right limits exist but differ. An infinite discontinuity occurs when limits approach infinity. The intermediate value theorem states that if f is continuous on closed interval from a to b and N is any value between f of a and f of b, then there exists c in the interval a to b such that f of c equals N. This guarantees continuous functions take all intermediate values.",
                        "intuition": "Think of a limit as predicting where a function is heading, even if it never quite arrives. Imagine driving toward a city: the limit is the city you are approaching, even if you stop short. Continuity means no sudden jumps or breaks, like a smooth road versus one with potholes or gaps. When evaluating limits, you are asking what value the function wants to reach as you get infinitely close to a point.",

The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. If we have a function y equals f of x, the derivative f prime of x or dy over dx represents the rate at which y changes as x changes. Geometrically, the derivative at a point equals the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point. The formal definition uses limits: f prime of x equals the limit as h approaches 0 of the quantity f of x plus h minus f of x all divided by h. This is called the difference quotient. Basic derivative rules include the power rule: if f of x equals x to the power n, then f prime of x equals n times x to the power n minus 1. The constant rule states the derivative of a constant is zero. The constant multiple rule: the derivative of c times f of x equals c times f prime of x. The sum rule: the derivative of f plus g equals f prime plus g prime. The product rule: the derivative of f times g equals f prime times g plus f times g prime. The quotient rule: the derivative of f over g equals the quantity g times f prime minus f times g prime all divided by g squared. The chain rule for composite functions: if y equals f of g of x, then dy over dx equals f prime of g of x times g prime of x. Applications include finding maximum and minimum values through critical points where f prime equals 0, analyzing concavity using the second derivative test, and solving related rates problems where multiple quantities change with respect to time.",

An indefinite integral or antiderivative of function f is a function F such that F prime of x equals f of x. We write the integral of f of x with respect to x equals F of x plus C, where C is the constant of integration. Basic integral formulas include: integral of x to the power n dx equals x to the power n plus 1 divided by n plus 1 plus C for n not equal to negative 1. Integral of e to the x dx equals e to the x plus C. Integral of sine x dx equals negative cosine x plus C. Integration techniques include substitution method, integration by parts, partial fractions for rational functions, and trigonometric substitution. The definite integral from a to b of f of x dx represents the signed area between the function and the x-axis from x equals a to x equals b. The fundamental theorem of calculus connects differentiation and integration, stating that if F is an antiderivative of f, then integral from a to b of f of x dx equals F of b minus F of a. Applications include calculating areas between curves, volumes of solids of revolution using disk and shell methods, arc lengths, and work done by variable forces. Integration is essential in physics for computing displacement from velocity, in probability for finding cumulative distributions, and in engineering for analyzing systems with continuous variables.",

Differential equations model change and are fundamental in science and engineering. A first-order differential equation involves only the first derivative. The general form is dy over dx equals f of x comma y. An nth-order equation involves the nth derivative. Linear differential equations have the dependent variable and all its derivatives appearing to the first power with no products. A separable differential equation can be written as dy over dx equals g of x times h of y, allowing separation: 1 over h of y times dy equals g of x dx. Integrating both sides gives the solution. For example, dy over dx equals 2xy has solution found by separating to get dy over y equals 2x dx, integrating to get natural log of absolute value of y equals x squared plus C, giving y equals A times e to the x squared. Linear first-order equations have form dy over dx plus P of x times y equals Q of x. These are solved using an integrating factor mu of x equals e to the integral of P of x dx. Multiplying the equation by mu makes the left side a perfect derivative, allowing integration. Initial value problems specify the function value at a point, determining the constant. Applications include population growth modeled by dy over dt equals ky, radioactive decay, Newton's law of cooling, electrical circuits with RC components, and mechanical systems with springs and dampers. Second-order linear differential equations like y double prime plus py prime plus qy equals 0 model oscillating systems and have solutions involving exponentials, sines, and cosines depending on the characteristic equation roots.",

In two dimensions, vector v equals vi plus vj where v1 and v2 are components and i and j are unit vectors along the x and y axes. In three dimensions, v equals v1i plus v2j plus v3k. The magnitude or length of vector v equals the square root of v1 squared plus v2 squared plus v3 squared. Vector addition follows the parallelogram rule geometrically and the component-wise rule algebraically: if u equals u1i plus u2j and v equals v1i plus v2j, then u plus v equals the quantity u1 plus v1 times i plus the quantity u2 plus v2 times j. Scalar multiplication by constant c scales the vector: c times v equals cv1i plus cv2j. The dot product or scalar product of vectors u and v is u dot v equals u1v1 plus u2v2 plus u3v3 equals the magnitude of u times the magnitude of v times cosine of the angle between them. The dot product is commutative and gives a scalar. It equals zero if vectors are orthogonal perpendicular. The cross product or vector product in three dimensions is u cross v equals a vector perpendicular to both u and v with magnitude equal to the magnitude of u times the magnitude of v times sine of the angle between them. The direction follows the right-hand rule. Algebraically, u cross v equals the determinant of the 3 by 3 matrix with first row i j k, second row u1 u2 u3, third row v1 v2 v3. The cross product is anti-commutative: u cross v equals negative v cross u. Applications include finding angles between vectors, testing parallelism and perpendicularity, computing areas of parallelograms and volumes of parallelepipeds, representing lines as r equals r0 plus t times d for parameter t and direction vector d, and representing planes as n dot the quantity r minus r0 equals 0 for normal vector n.",

                        "theory": "Combinatorics is the mathematics of counting and arranging objects. The fundamental counting principle states that if one event can occur in m ways and another independent event can occur in n ways, then both events can occur in m times n ways. A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is denoted P of n comma r or nPr and equals n factorial divided by the quantity n minus r factorial, where n factorial equals n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 times dot dot dot times 2 times 1. For example, the number of ways to arrange 3 books from 5 distinct books is 5P3 equals 5 factorial divided by 2 factorial equals 120 divided by 2 equals 60. When all n objects are arranged, we have n factorial permutations. A combination is a selection of objects where order does not matter. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted C of n comma r or nCr or n choose r and equals n factorial divided by the quantity r factorial times the quantity n minus r factorial. For example, choosing 3 books from 5 is 5C3 equals 5 factorial divided by 3 factorial times 2 factorial equals 120 divided by 6 times 2 equals 10. Combinations are related to binomial coefficients in the binomial theorem: the quantity a plus b to the power n equals the sum from k equals 0 to n of n choose k times a to the power n minus k times b to the power k. Pascal's triangle displays binomial coefficients where each entry equals the sum of the two entries above it. Permutations with repetition allow repeated objects. If object 1 repeats r1 times, object 2 repeats r2 times, up to object k repeats rk times, and r1 plus dot dot dot plus rk equals n, the number of permutations is n factorial divided by r1 factorial times dot dot dot times rk factorial. Circular permutations of n objects equal the quantity n minus 1 factorial.

Random variables can be discrete, taking on countable values, or continuous, taking on values in an interval. The probability distribution of a random variable describes the probabilities associated with each possible value or range of values. For a discrete random variable X, the probability mass function PMF denoted P of X equals x or p of x gives the probability that X takes the value x. The PMF satisfies two properties: p of x greater than or equal to 0 for all x, and the sum of p of x over all possible x equals 1. The cumulative distribution function CDF denoted F of x equals P of X less than or equal to x. The expected value or mean of discrete X is E of X equals the sum of x times p of x over all x, representing the long-run average value. Variance measures spread: Var of X equals E of the quantity X minus mu squared equals E of X squared minus the quantity E of X squared. Standard deviation equals the square root of variance. The binomial distribution models the number of successes in n independent trials each with success probability p. X follows binomial with parameters n and p has PMF P of X equals k equals n choose k times p to the k times the quantity 1 minus p to the power n minus k for k equals 0 to n. Mean equals np, variance equals np times 1 minus p. The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval when events happen at a constant average rate lambda. PMF is P of X equals k equals lambda to the k times e to the negative lambda divided by k factorial. Mean and variance both equal lambda. For continuous random variables, the probability density function PDF f of x satisfies f of x greater than or equal to 0 and the integral from negative infinity to infinity of f of x dx equals 1. Probabilities are areas: P of a less than X less than b equals the integral from a to b of f of x dx. The normal distribution with mean mu and variance sigma squared has bell-shaped PDF proportional to e to the negative the quantity x minus mu squared divided by 2 sigma squared. The standard normal distribution has mu equals 0 and sigma equals 1. Z-scores transform any normal variable to standard normal via z equals the quantity x minus mu divided by sigma. The normal distribution is ubiquitous due to the central limit theorem stating that sums of independent random variables tend toward normal distribution regardless of original distributions.",

A vector space over a field F is a set V with operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication satisfying eight axioms including closure, associativity, commutativity of addition, existence of additive identity and inverses, and distributive properties. Examples include Euclidean space R to the n, polynomial spaces, and function spaces. A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations. Linear independence of vectors means no vector can be written as a linear combination of others. A basis is a linearly independent set that spans the vector space. Dimension equals the number of vectors in any basis. A linear transformation T from vector space V to W satisfies T of u plus v equals T of u plus T of v and T of cv equals cT of v. Linear transformations can be represented by matrices. The kernel or null space is the set of vectors mapping to zero. The range or image is the set of all possible outputs. The rank-nullity theorem states dimension of domain equals rank plus nullity. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are scalars lambda and nonzero vectors v satisfying Av equals lambda v for square matrix A. The characteristic equation determinant of A minus lambda I equals 0 gives eigenvalues. Eigenspaces are subspaces of eigenvectors. Diagonalization writes A equals PDP inverse where D is diagonal with eigenvalues and P has eigenvectors as columns, valid when A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. Orthogonal matrices have orthonormal columns and satisfy Q transpose Q equals I. The spectral theorem states real symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalizable. Applications include principal component analysis in statistics, Google's PageRank algorithm, quantum mechanics operators, and solving differential equations systems.

The graph is a surface in three dimensions. Level curves where f of x comma y equals c are curves of constant function value, like contour lines on topographic maps. Partial derivatives measure rate of change with respect to one variable while holding others constant. The partial of f with respect to x, written as the partial derivative symbol f over the partial x or f sub x, is the limit as h approaches 0 of the quantity f of x plus h comma y minus f of x comma y all divided by h. Higher-order partial derivatives include the second partial f sub xx and mixed partials f sub xy and f sub yx. If f has continuous mixed partials, Clairaut's theorem states f sub xy equals f sub yx. The gradient of f, denoted grad f or del f, is the vector of partial derivatives: grad f equals the partial of f with respect to x times i plus the partial of f with respect to y times j. The gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent, and its magnitude equals the maximum directional derivative. The chain rule for multivariable functions: if z equals f of x comma y and x and y are functions of t, then dz over dt equals the partial of f over the partial x times dx over dt plus the partial of f over the partial y times dy over dt. Critical points where all partial derivatives are zero are candidates for local extrema. The second derivative test uses the discriminant D equals f sub xx times f sub yy minus the quantity f sub xy squared. Double integrals compute volumes and areas: double integral over region R of f of x comma y dA. Iterated integrals evaluate double integrals: integral from a to b integral from c to d of f of x comma y dy dx. Triple integrals extend to three dimensions for mass and volume calculations. Change of variables uses the Jacobian determinant. Vector fields assign vectors to points. Divergence div F measures expansion, curl F measures rotation. Line integrals integrate along curves. Green's theorem relates line integrals around closed curves to double integrals over regions. Stokes' theorem and divergence theorem generalize these relationships in three dimensions.",

                        "theory": "Optimization is finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, typically maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to constraints. Unconstrained optimization of differentiable function f involves finding critical points where gradient equals zero. The Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives determines whether critical points are local minima, maxima, or saddle points through eigenvalue analysis or definiteness tests. Constrained optimization adds equality or inequality constraints. The method of Lagrange multipliers handles equality constraints: to optimize f of x comma y subject to g of x comma y equals c, form the Lagrangian L of x comma y comma lambda equals f of x comma y minus lambda times the quantity g of x comma y minus c, where lambda is the Lagrange multiplier. Set gradients to zero: grad f equals lambda grad g and g equals c. This gives a system of equations for x, y, and lambda. Geometrically, at the optimum, the gradients of f and g are parallel. The Kuhn-Tucker conditions extend this to inequality constraints, important in economics and operations research. Linear programming optimizes a linear objective function subject to linear inequality constraints. The feasible region is a polyhedron, and the optimum occurs at a vertex. The simplex algorithm systematically searches vertices. Applications include resource allocation, production planning, and transportation problems. Integer programming requires variables to be integers, used in scheduling and network design. Convex optimization involves convex objective functions and convex feasible sets. Local minima are global minima, making these problems tractable. Quadratic programming has quadratic objective with linear constraints. Gradient descent is an iterative numerical method: starting from initial guess, repeatedly update x new equals x old minus alpha grad f of x old, where alpha is the learning rate or step size. Convergence requires choosing alpha appropriately. Stochastic gradient descent uses random subsets of data, fundamental in training machine learning models. Newton's method uses second-order information: x new equals x old minus Hessian inverse times grad f. Conjugate gradient methods avoid computing the Hessian. Practical optimization software implements these algorithms with features like line search and trust regions.",

The bisection method repeatedly halves an interval known to contain a root, guaranteed to converge but slowly. Newton's method or Newton-Raphson uses the iteration x new equals x old minus f of x old divided by f prime of x old, converging quadratically when close to the root but requiring derivative evaluation. The secant method approximates the derivative using finite differences. Fixed-point iteration solves x equals g of x by iterating x new equals g of x old. Convergence requires absolute value of g prime less than 1 near the fixed point. Systems of nonlinear equations extend these methods using Jacobian matrices. Numerical differentiation approximates derivatives using difference quotients. Forward difference: f prime of x approximately equals the quantity f of x plus h minus f of x divided by h. Central difference: f prime of x approximately equals the quantity f of x plus h minus f of x minus h divided by 2h, which has higher accuracy. Numerical errors include truncation error from approximation and roundoff error from finite precision arithmetic. Numerical integration or quadrature approximates definite integrals. The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral from a to b of f of x dx approximately equals the quantity b minus a divided by 2 times the quantity f of a plus f of b. Simpson's rule uses parabolic approximation: integral approximately equals the quantity b minus a divided by 6 times the quantity f of a plus 4f of the quantity a plus b over 2 plus f of b. Adaptive quadrature adjusts step size based on function behavior. Monte Carlo integration uses random sampling, effective for high-dimensional integrals. Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations: Euler's method for dy over dx equals f of x comma y uses y new equals y old plus h times f of x old comma y old for step size h. Improved methods include Runge-Kutta methods, particularly the fourth-order RK4 with higher accuracy. Multi-step methods like Adams-Bashforth use information from several previous steps. Stability analysis ensures errors do not grow unboundedly. Stiff equations require implicit methods. Partial differential equations are solved using finite difference, finite element, or spectral methods, discretizing space and time. Linear systems Ax equals b are solved iteratively using Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, or conjugate gradient methods for large sparse matrices. Singular value decomposition handles ill-conditioned systems.",

                        "theory": "Probability theory provides the mathematical foundation for studying randomness. Axiomatic probability, formalized by Kolmogorov, defines probability on a sigma-algebra of events in a sample space. A sigma-algebra F is a collection of subsets closed under complements and countable unions. A probability measure P assigns to each event A in F a number P of A in the interval from 0 to 1 satisfying P of the sample space equals 1 and countable additivity: for disjoint events A1 A2 and so on, P of the union equals the sum of P of Ai. Conditional probability P of A given B equals P of A intersection B divided by P of B formalizes updating beliefs given information. Independence of events satisfies P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B. The law of total probability partitions the sample space: P of A equals the sum of P of A given Bi times P of Bi over partition B1 B2 and so on. Bayes' theorem updates probabilities: P of Bi given A equals the quantity P of A given Bi times P of Bi all divided by P of A. Random variables are measurable functions from the sample space to the real numbers. Expected value, variance, moment generating function, and characteristic function characterize distributions. Conditional expectation E of X given Y generalizes conditional probability, crucial in stochastic processes and filtering. Inequalities like Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Jensen's bound probabilities and expectations. The law of large numbers states that sample averages converge to the expected value as sample size increases. The weak law states convergence in probability, the strong law states almost sure convergence. The central limit theorem asserts that standardized sums of independent identically distributed random variables with finite variance converge in distribution to standard normal, explaining the prevalence of normal distributions in nature. Stochastic processes are collections of random variables indexed by time or space. The Poisson process models random events occurring over time with independent increments. Markov chains have the memoryless property that future states depend only on the present state, not the past. Transition matrices govern state evolution. Stationary distributions satisfy equilibrium equations. Brownian motion is a continuous-time stochastic process with independent normally distributed increments, fundamental in physics and finance. Martingales satisfy E of X n plus 1 given X1 to Xn equals Xn, modeling fair games. Applications span finance for option pricing, queueing theory in operations research, signal processing, genetics, and machine learning.",

Data is represented as vectors and matrices. A dataset with n samples of d features forms an n by d matrix X. Weight vectors w parameterize linear models. Linear regression minimizes the squared error between predictions X w and targets y, solved via normal equations X transpose X w equals X transpose y or gradient descent. Principal component analysis PCA reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto eigenvectors of the covariance matrix corresponding to largest eigenvalues, capturing maximum variance. Support vector machines find the maximum-margin hyperplane separating classes, formulated as a quadratic programming problem with Lagrange multipliers. The kernel trick implicitly maps data to high-dimensional spaces via kernel functions k of x comma x prime without explicit computation. Neural networks are compositions of linear transformations and nonlinear activation functions. Backpropagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to weights using the chain rule, enabling gradient descent optimization. Stochastic gradient descent updates weights using gradients computed on mini-batches, crucial for large datasets. Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 penalties prevent overfitting by constraining weight magnitudes. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training. Probabilistic models represent uncertainty. Naive Bayes classifiers apply Bayes' theorem assuming feature independence. Gaussian mixture models represent data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, parameters estimated via expectation-maximization algorithm. Bayesian inference treats parameters as random variables with prior distributions, updating to posterior distributions given data via Bayes' theorem. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods like Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings approximate posterior distributions when integrals are intractable. Variational inference approximates posteriors by optimizing a simpler distribution. Reinforcement learning models sequential decision-making. Markov decision processes formalize states, actions, rewards, and transitions. Q-learning updates action-value functions via temporal difference learning. Policy gradient methods optimize policies directly via gradients. Deep learning combines neural networks with representation learning. Convolutional neural networks use translation-invariant filters for image processing. Recurrent neural networks handle sequential data with hidden states. Attention mechanisms and transformers revolutionized natural language processing. Optimization challenges include non-convexity, saddle points, and vanishing gradients. Momentum accelerates convergence. Adaptive learning rate methods like Adam adjust step sizes per parameter. Batch normalization stabilizes training.

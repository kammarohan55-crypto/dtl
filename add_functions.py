        "theory": "A function is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. A function describes a special relationship between two sets where each input is associated with exactly one output. Think of a function as a machine: you put something in, the machine processes it according to a rule, and you get exactly one thing out. Formally, a function f from set A to set B is a rule that assigns to each element x in A exactly one element y in B. We write this as f colon A maps to B. The element y is called the image of x under f, and we write y equals f of x, read as f of x. The set A is called the domain of the function, which contains all possible input values. The set B is called the codomain, while the range is the set of all actual output values. The range is a subset of the codomain. For example, consider the function f of x equals x squared where the domain is all real numbers. For any input x, the output is x squared. If x equals 3, then f of 3 equals 9. If x equals negative 2, then f of negative 2 equals 4. Notice that different inputs can give the same output with functions like x squared, but each input gives exactly one output. This is the key property: one input maps to one output. Function notation f of x is extremely useful. It clearly shows that f is the name of the function and x is the input variable. To evaluate a function at a specific value, substitute that value for x. For example, if f of x equals 3x minus 5, then f of 2 equals 3 times 2 minus 5 equals 6 minus 5 equals 1. Similarly, f of 0 equals 3 times 0 minus 5 equals negative 5. We can also evaluate functions at algebraic expressions. For f of x equals x squared plus 2x and finding f of a plus 1, we substitute a plus 1 for every x: f of a plus 1 equals the quantity a plus 1 squared plus 2 times the quantity a plus 1 equals a squared plus 2a plus 1 plus 2a plus 2 equals a squared plus 4a plus 3. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined. For polynomial functions like f of x equals 2x cubed minus 5x plus 1, the domain is all real numbers because you can square, cube, or perform any polynomial operation on any real number. However, some functions have restrictions. For rational functions with denominators, we must exclude values that make the denominator zero. For example, f of x equals 1 divided by the quantity x  minus 3 has domain all real numbers except x equals 3, because at x equals 3 the denominator becomes zero and division by zero is undefined. For square root functions, we need the expression under the radical to be non-negative. The function f of x equals the square root of x has domain x greater than or equal to 0, because square roots of negative numbers are not real. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. Finding the range requires analyzing what values the function can produce. For f of x equals x squared with domain all real numbers, what outputs are possible? Since any real number squared is non-negative, and we can get arbitrarily large positive values, the range is all real numbers y such that y greater than or equal to 0. For f of x equals x squared plus 1, since x squared is at least 0, the minimum value is 1, so the range is y greater than or equal to 1. A vertical line test helps determine if a curve represents a function. If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, it is not a function, because one input would correspond to multiple outputs. For example, the circle x squared plus y squared equals 4 is not a function because a vertical line at x equals 0 intersects at y equals 2 and y equals negative 2. Functions can be classified by type. Linear functions have the form f of x equals mx plus b, where m and b are constants. Their graphs are straight lines. Quadratic functions have the form f of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c where a is not zero. Their graphs are parabolas. Polynomial functions have the form f of x equals a sub n times x to the power n plus a sub n minus 1 times x to the power n minus 1 plus dot dot dot plus a sub 1 times x plus a sub 0. Rational functions are ratios of polynomials, f of x equals p of x divided by q of x where p and q are polynomials. Absolute value functions have the form f of x equals the absolute value of x or variations. Piecewise functions are defined by different formulas for different parts of the domain. Function operations allow us to create new functions from existing ones. If f and g are functions, we can define sum f plus g, difference f minus g, product f times g, and quotient f divided by g. For sum, the quantity f plus g of x equals f of x plus g of x. The domain is the intersection of the domains of f and g. For example, if f of x equals 2x and g of x equals x plus 3, then the quantity f plus g of x equals 2x plus x plus 3 equals 3x plus 3. Composition of functions is a powerful operation. The composition f composed with g, written as f circle g or f of g of x, means apply g first, then apply f to the result. Formally, f of g of x equals f applied to the quantity g of x. The domain of f composed with g consists of all x in the domain of g such that g of x is in the domain of f. For example, if f of x equals x squared and g of x equals x plus 1, then f of g of x equals f of the quantity x plus 1 equals the quantity x plus 1 squared equals x squared plus 2x plus 1. Note that g of f of x equals g of x squared equals x squared plus 1, which is different. Composition is generally not commutative. Even and odd functions have special symmetry properties. A function f is even if f of negative x equals f of x for all x in the domain. Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. Examples include f of x equals x squared and f of x equals cosine x. A function f is odd if f of negative x equals negative f of x for all x in the domain. Odd functions have rotational symmetry about the origin. Examples include f of x equals x cubed and f of x equals sine x. One-to-one functions are functions where different inputs always give different outputs. Formally, f is one-to-one if whenever f of a equals f of b, then a equals b. Equivalently, if a does not equal b, then f of a does not equal f of b. The horizontal line test determines if a function is one-to-one: if any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is not one-to-one. For example, f of x equals x cubed is one-to-one, but f of x equals x squared is not because f of 2 equals f of negative 2 equals 4. Inverse functions reverse the action of a function. If f is a one-to-one function with domain A and range B, the inverse function f inverse has domain B and range A, and it satisfies f inverse of f of x equals x for all x in A, and f of f inverse of y equals y for all y in B. To find an inverse function, replace f of x with y, swap x and y, and solve for y. For example, find the inverse of f of x equals 2x minus 3. Write y equals 2x minus 3, swap to get x equals 2y minus 3, solve for y: x plus 3 equals 2y, so y equals the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2. Thus f inverse of x equals the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2. Verify: f of f inverse of x equals f of the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2 equals 2 times the quantity x plus 3 divided by 2 minus 3 equals x plus 3 minus 3 equals x. Increasing and decreasing functions describe how function values change. A function f is increasing on an interval if whenever a is less than b, then f of a is less than f of b. It is decreasing on an interval if whenever a is less than b, then f of a is greater than f of b. For example, f of x equals x squared is decreasing on the interval negative infinity to 0 and increasing on 0 to positive infinity.",
        "intuition": "Think of a function as a vending machine. You select an item code (input), press a button, and get exactly one snack (output). You cannot get two different snacks from the same code, which is why a function must give exactly one output per input. Different codes might give the same snack, just as different x values can give the same f of x value. The domain is all available codes, and the range is all possible snacks the machine can dispense.",

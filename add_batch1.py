        "theory": "Coordinate geometry, also called analytic geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. This powerful method bridges algebra and geometry, allowing us to represent geometric figures using algebraic equations and solve geometric problems using algebraic techniques. The foundation of coordinate geometry is the Cartesian coordinate system, named after the French mathematician Rene Descartes. The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular number lines called axes. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis, and the vertical axis is called the y-axis. These axes intersect at a point called the origin, denoted O, which has coordinates zero comma zero. The axes divide the plane into four regions called quadrants. Quadrant I is the upper right region where both x and y coordinates are positive. Quadrant II is the upper left where x is negative and y is positive. Quadrant III is the lower left where both are negative. Quadrant IV is the lower right where x is positive and y is negative. Any point in the plane can be represented by an ordered pair of numbers parentheses x comma y called coordinates. The first number x is the x-coordinate or abscissa, indicating the horizontal distance from the origin. The second number y is the y-coordinate or ordinate, indicating the vertical distance from the origin. To plot a point with coordinates parentheses a comma b, start at the origin, move a units horizontally (right if positive, left if negative), then move b units vertically (up if positive, down if negative). For example, the point parentheses 3 comma 2 is located 3 units right and 2 units up from the origin. The point parentheses negative 2 comma 4 is 2 units left and 4 units up. The distance formula calculates the distance between two points. If we have points P1 with coordinates parentheses x1 comma y1 and P2 with coordinates parentheses x2 comma y2, the distance d between them is found using the Pythagorean theorem. Imagine a right triangle where the distance between the points is the hypotenuse. The horizontal leg has length the absolute value of x2 minus x1, and the vertical leg has length the absolute value of y2 minus y1. By the Pythagorean theorem, d squared equals the quantity x2 minus x1 squared plus the quantity y2 minus y1 squared. Taking the square root of both sides gives d equals the square root of the quantity x2 minus x1 squared plus the quantity y2 minus y1 squared. For example, find the distance between parentheses 1 comma 2 and parentheses 4 comma 6. Using the formula: d equals the square root of the quantity 4 minus 1 squared plus the quantity 6 minus 2 squared equals the square root of 3 squared plus 4 squared equals the square root of 9 plus 16 equals the square root of 25 equals 5. The midpoint formula finds the point exactly halfway between two given points. If P1 has coordinates parentheses x1 comma y1 and P2 has coordinates parentheses x2 comma y2, the midpoint M has coordinates parentheses the quantity x1 plus x2 divided by 2 comma the quantity y1 plus y2 divided by 2. In other words, the midpoint coordinates are the averages of the corresponding coordinates. For example, the midpoint between parentheses 2 comma 3 and parentheses 8 comma 7 is parentheses the quantity 2 plus 8 divided by 2 comma the quantity 3 plus 7 divided by 2 equals parentheses 5 comma 5. The slope of a line measures its steepness and direction. slope is defined as rise over run, or the change in y divided by the change in x. For a line passing through points parentheses x1 comma y1 and parentheses x2 comma y2 where x1 does not equal x2, the slope m equals y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1. Positive slope means the line rises from left to right. Negative slope means the line falls from left to right. Zero slope indicates a horizontal line. Undefined slope corresponds to a vertical line where x1 equals x2. For example, find the slope of the line through parentheses 1 comma 2 and parentheses 5 comma 10. The slope m equals 10 minus 2 divided by 5 minus 1 equals 8 divided by 4 equals 2. Parallel lines have equal slopes. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. If line 1 has slope m1 and line 2 has slope m2, and the lines are perpendicular, then m1 times m2 equals negative 1, or m2 equals negative 1 divided by m1. Linear equations can be written in several forms. The slope-intercept form is y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept (the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis). This form is most convenient for graphing. The point-slope form is y minus y1 equals m times the quantity x minus x1, where m is the slope and parentheses x1 comma y1 is a point on the line. This form is useful when you know a point and the slope. The standard form is Ax plus By equals C, where A, B, and C are constants with A and B not both zero. This form is useful for some algebraic manipulations. The general form is Ax plus By plus C equals 0. To convert between forms, use algebraic manipulation. For example, convert y minus 3 equals 2 times the quantity x minus 1 to slope-intercept form: distribute to get y minus 3 equals 2x minus 2, then add 3 to both sides to get y equals 2x plus 1. A circle is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The standard equation of a circle with center parentheses h comma k and radius r is the quantity x minus h squared plus the quantity y minus k squared equals r squared. This comes directly from the distance formula. If the center is at the origin parentheses 0 comma 0, the equation simplifies to x squared plus y squared equals r squared. For example, the equation the quantity x minus 2 squared plus the quantity y plus 3 squared equals 25 represents a circle with center parentheses 2 comma negative 3 and radius 5. To find the equation given the center and radius, substitute into the standard form. Given center parentheses 1 comma 4 and radius 3, the equation is the quantity x minus 1 squared plus the quantity y minus 4 squared equals 9.",
        "intuition": "Think of the coordinate plane as a city map where every location has an address given by street numbers (x-coordinate) and avenue numbers (y-coordinate). The distance formula is like finding the shortest walking distance between two locations. The slope of a line is like the steepness of a hill: a steep uphill has large positive slope, downhill has negative slope, and flat ground has zero slope. Coordinate geometry lets us describe shapes with numbers and equations, making geometric problems solvable with algebra.",

# Module 7: Probability Basics

    ],
    "core_content": {
        "theory": "Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and the likelihood of events occurring. In everyday life, we constantly make decisions based on probability, whether consciously or not. When we check the weather forecast, buy insurance, or play games, we are dealing with probability. The mathematical study of probability provides a rigorous framework for quantifying uncertainty. An experiment or trial is any procedure that can be repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes. For example, flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card from a deck are all experiments. The sample space, denoted S or omega, is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a single coin flip, S equals the set containing H comma T where H represents heads and T represents tails. For rolling a standard six-sided die, S equals the set containing 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6. An event is any subset of the sample space. An event can consist of a single outcome or multiple outcomes. For example, when rolling a die, the event getting an even number is the set containing 2 comma 4 comma 6. Events are typically denoted by capital letters like A, B, or E. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood of the event occurring. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible and will never occur. A probability of 1 means the event is certain and will always occur. Probabilities between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of likelihood. We write P of A for the probability of event A. The classical or theoretical definition of probability applies when all outcomes are equally likely. If an experiment has n equally likely outcomes and an event A consists of m of those outcomes, then P of A equals m divided by n. In other words, P of A equals the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when rolling a fair die, the probability of getting a 3 is P of 3 equals 1 divided by 6, because there is 1 favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of 6 total outcomes. The probability of getting an even number is P of even equals 3 divided by 6 equals 1 half, because there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 total. Properties of probability provide important rules. First, the probability of any event is between 0 and 1: 0 less than or equal to P of A less than or equal to 1. Second, the probability of the certain event (the entire sample space) is 1: P of S equals 1. Third, the probability of the impossible event (the empty set) is 0: P of empty set equals 0. The complement of an event A, denoted A prime or A with a bar over it or A complement, consists of all outcomes NOT in A. The complement rule states that P of A complement equals 1 minus P of A. This is useful because sometimes it is easier to calculate the probability that an event does not occur. For example, when rolling a die, the probability of NOT getting a 6 is P of not 6 equals 1 minus P of 6 equals 1 minus 1 sixth equals 5 sixths. The addition rule deals with the probability of the union of events. For any two events A and B, the probability that A or B or both occur is P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B minus P of A intersection B. We subtract P of A intersection B because when we add P of A and P of B, we count the outcomes in both A and B twice. If events A and B are mutually exclusive or disjoint, meaning they cannot both occur simultaneously (their intersection is empty), then P of A intersection B equals 0, and the addition rule simplifies to P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B. For example, when rolling a die, let A be the event of getting a 2 and B be the event of getting a 5. These are mutually exclusive. P of A union B equals P of A plus P of B equals 1 sixth plus 1 sixth equals 2 sixths equals 1 third. Conditional probability measures the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The conditional probability of A given B, written P of A given B or P of A vertical bar B, is the probability that A occurs given that we know B has occurred. The formula is P of A given B equals P of A intersection B divided by P of B, provided P of B is not zero. For example, suppose we draw a card from a standard 52-card deck. Let A be the event that the card is an ace and B be the event that the card is a spade. P of A equals 4 divided by 52 equals 1 thirteenth because there are 4 aces. P of B equals 13 divided by 52 equals 1 fourth because there are 13 spades. A intersection B is the event of getting the ace of spades, so P of A intersection B equals 1 divided by 52. The conditional probability P of A given B equals the quantity 1 divided by 52 divided by the quantity 13 divided by 52 equals 1 divided by 13. This makes sense: if we know the card is a spade, there is 1 ace among the 13 spades. Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, A and B are independent if P of A given B equals P of A, or equivalently, P of B given A equals P of B. For independent events, we have the multiplication rule: P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B. For example, flipping a coin twice, let A be getting heads on the first flip and B be getting heads on the second flip. These are independent. P of A equals 1 half and P of B equals 1 half, so P of both heads equals P of A times P of B equals 1 half times 1 half equals 1 fourth. If events are not independent, they are dependent, and we use the general multiplication rule: P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B given A equals P of B times P of A given B.",
        "intuition": "Think of probability as a measure of how often something would happen if you repeated an experiment many times. If you flip a fair coin thousands of times, you expect about half to be heads, which is why P of heads equals one half. Conditional probability is like updating your expectations based on new information. If you know it is raining, the probability someone is carrying an umbrella increases, even though on a random day it might be low. Independent events are like separate experiments that do not influence each other, like flipping two different coins.",

            {"problem": "When rolling two dice, find the probability that the sum is 7.", "solution": "Total outcomes equals 6 times 6 equals 36. Favorable outcomes giving sum 7 are: parentheses 1 comma 6, parentheses 2 comma 5, parentheses 3 comma 4, parentheses 4 comma 3, parentheses 5 comma 2, parentheses 6 comma 1, which is 6 outcomes. P of sum equals 7 equals 6 divided by 36 equals 1 sixth."},
            {"problem": "If P of A equals 0.6, P of B equals 0.4, and A and B are independent, find P of A and B both occurring.", "solution": "Since A and B are independent, P of A intersection B equals P of A times P of B equals 0.6 times 0.4 equals 0.24."},

## Module Summary for: Linear Equations (Beginner Level)

---

**Module Summary:**
This module covers linear equations, which are fundamental algebraic statements where variables appear only to the first power. You learned how to solve equations in one variable systematically, translate word problems into mathematical equations, and graph linear equations in two variables on the coordinate plane.

**Key Concepts:**
- A linear equation has the highest power of the variable equal to 1 (example: 2x + 3 = 7)
- Solving means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true
- The balance principle: whatever you do to one side, do to the other side
- Linear equations in two variables (like y = 2x + 1) have infinitely many solutions forming a straight line
- Slope measures steepness and direction; y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis
- Slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) is most useful for graphing

**Intuition:**
- Think of equations like a balance scale - both sides must stay equal, so any operation on one side must be done on the other
- Solving is like detective work: you're isolating the unknown variable step by step
- For two-variable equations, every solution is a point, and connecting all these points creates a straight line (that's why we call them "linear")
- Slope as "rise over run" tells you how much the line goes up or down for each step right
- Positive slope = line rises left to right; negative slope = line falls left to right

**Worked Examples:**

*Example 1: Solve 4(2x - 3) = 5x + 9*
- Expand using distributive property: 8x - 12 = 5x + 9
- Move variables to left, constants to right: 8x - 5x = 9 + 12
- Simplify: 3x = 21
- Divide both sides by 3: x = 7
- Check: Left side = 4(14 - 3) = 44; Right side = 35 + 9 = 44 ✓

*Example 2: Rectangle problem*
- A rectangle's length is 5 meters more than twice its width
- Perimeter is 46 meters, find dimensions
- Let w = width, then length = 2w + 5
- Perimeter formula: 2(length) + 2(width) = 46
- Equation: 2(2w + 5) + 2w = 46
- Solve: 4w + 10 + 2w = 46 → 6w = 36 → w = 6 meters
- Length = 2(6) + 5 = 17 meters

*Example 3: Consecutive integers*
- Find three consecutive integers whose sum is 72
- Let first integer = x, then next two are x + 1 and x + 2
- Equation: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 72
- Simplify: 3x + 3 = 72
- Solve: 3x = 69 → x = 23
- The integers are 23, 24, and 25

*Example 4: Graphing y = -2x + 3*
- This is in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b)
- Slope m = -2, y-intercept b = 3
- Start at point (0, 3) on the y-axis
- Slope -2 means: move 1 right, move 2 down
- From (0, 3): go right 1, down 2 → get point (1, 1)
- Draw a line through both points

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to apply operations to BOTH sides of the equation
- Sign errors when moving terms across the equals sign (forgetting signs change)
- Distributing negative signs incorrectly: -(x - 3) should be -x + 3, not -x - 3
- Dividing by zero or multiplying both sides by zero
- In word problems, misunderstanding phrases like "decreased by" or "less than" (order matters)

**Exam / Revision Takeaways:**
- **Master the balance principle**: same operation on both sides always
- **For fractions**: multiply through by LCM of denominators to clear them
- **Always verify**: substitute your answer back into the original equation
- **Word problems**: clearly define your variable before writing the equation
- **Graphing shortcut**: slope-intercept form y = mx + b is easiest
- **Remember**: parallel lines have equal slopes; perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes
- **Check your work** by ensuring left side = right side after substituting your solution
